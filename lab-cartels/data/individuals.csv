Genaro García Luna,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/genaro-garcia-luna/,Genaro García Luna,,./images/individuals/genaro-garcía-luna.jpg,2023-01-18,"['elites and crime', 'mexico', 'mexico personalities']",mexico,"Genaro García Luna is the former head of Mexico's Federal Investigation Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigación - AFI) and was the country's public security minister from 2006 to 2012. While in the cabinet of President Felipe Calderón, García Luna was seen as a crucial architect of the militarization of Mexico's response to organized crime.However, the man charged with leading the country's fight against drug traffickers was instead actively aiding them, according to prosecutors.The so-called ""super cop"" was allegedly in cahoots with the Sinaloa Cartel, formerly led by Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Chapo."" He is accused of having received millions of dollars in bribes from the group in exchange for guaranteeing the safe passage of tons of cocaine from Mexico to the United States, as well as targeting their rivals to help strengthen the cartel's position.Additionally, he is accused of being part of a scheme that cheated the Mexican government out of $250 million.He was arrested in December 2019, and, after more than three years of buildup, his trial began in January 2023. He has denied all drug trafficking and perjury charges leveled against him.","García Luna, who was born on July 10, 1968, in Mexico City, was reportedly familiar with those on both sides of the law from a young age. As a child, he told officers from the now-defunct Federal Security Directorate (Dirección Federal de Seguridad - DFS) about which local merchants were doing well so that the agents could extort them, according to Infobae. The report claims he took part in a robbery in Romero Rubio, a neighborhood of the Mexican capital, when he was 19 years old but avoided prison. Then, after failing the exam to join the federal police, he became an agent with the Center for Investigation and National Security (Centro de Investigación y Seguridad Nacional - Cisen).Although he was initially tasked with monitoring guerrilla groups, he later shifted his focus to tackling groups dedicated to kidnapping. His success in helping locate and rescue several high-profile businessmen reportedly allowed him to rise through the ranks.He left Cisen to join the Federal Preventive Police and later the AFI, which he led from 2001 until 2005. In 2006, former president Felipe Calderón named García Luna as minister for public security, a position he held until 2012 when he left Mexico for Miami.He was one of the driving forces behind Mexico's militarization in its fight against drug trafficking. Yet during his time in these positions of power, he acted as a major ally for the Sinaloa Cartel, ensuring their cocaine shipments to the United States left Mexico without any problems, feeding the organization privileged information, and targeting the group's rivals, prosecutors claim. His alleged reward: more than $50 million in bribes.García Luna's time as a free man in the United States came to an end on December 9, 2019, when officers arrested him in Dallas, Texas, shortly after a grand jury had charged him with conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine, as well as one count of making false statements. A superseding indictment was brought against him in July 2020.In an exciting development, in October 2022, prosecutors sought to submit further evidence against him based on secretly recorded conversations he allegedly had with his cellmate, who turned out to be a New York District Attorney's Office informant.In one of the conversations, García Luna apparently admitted to trying to remove key witnesses in his trial, including Jesús Zambada García, ""El Rey,"" the brother of the Sinaloa Cartel's current leader, Ismael Zambada García, alias"" El Mayo."" Zambada was a crucial witness during El Chapo's trial and testified that the Sinaloa Cartel had bribed García Luna for his cooperation.He has also been accused of bribing or threatening journalists to avoid negative press during his tenure as public security minister.His trial, which is being presided over by the same judge who condemned El Chapo to life in prison in July 2019, began on January 17, 2023.García Luna has firmly denied all charges against him.","The charges García Luna faces in the United States are based on the relationship he allegedly maintained with the Sinaloa Cartel.He is accused of receiving tens of millions of dollars worth of bribes since 2001 in exchange for aiding the cartel in its quest for dominance of the Mexican drug trafficking industry.According to the charges, he abused his position to ensure that cartel drug shipments left Mexico without any interference from the authorities. His charges posit that on six occasions between 2002 and 2008, he was involved in importing more than 50 metric tons of cocaine, with a street value of billions of dollars.García Luna allegedly provided the Sinaloa Cartel with information about law enforcement operations against them, warned them in advance of planned arrests of its members, and assisted in the release of detained gang members.Prosecutors also assert that thanks to these bribes, García Luna ensured that security operations targeted rival cartels instead of his paymasters, and that he put corrupt officials in positions of power in areas controlled by the Sinaloa Cartel.García Luna avoided prosecution throughout his time in office. But just two weeks after his arrest in Dallas, authorities from Mexico's Financial Intelligence Unit (Unidad de Inteligencia Financiera - UIF), having apparently only recently discovered and investigated his money laundering operation, filed complaints against him with Mexican anti-corruption prosecutors.Beyond the cartel links, García Luna also faces accusations that he, along with another high-ranking Mexican government official, several business associates, a network of companies, and his wife, unlawfully swindled $250 million from the Mexican government using a ""complicated unlawful government-contracting scheme."" The money was allegedly smuggled out of Mexico using an ""extensive"" network to ""hide the stolen funds in numerous assets"" located in the United States. In September 2021, the UIF announced its first civil lawsuit abroad in an attempt to recover the assets.     ","While his authority as Minister of Public Security did not extend beyond Mexico's borders, his alleged involvement with the Sinaloa Cartel allowed them to move cocaine from his original home country to the United States.His funds, however, have been on some genuinely globetrotting adventures, if the accusations against him are correct. He has been accused of using tax havens located around the world - including the United States, Barbados, and Hong Kong, of hiding the millions of dollars worth of bribes he allegedly took.","During his time as the head of the Federal Investigation Agency and as public security minister, García Luna was allegedly a vital ally of the Sinaloa Cartel as it expanded its operations, if the prosecution's charges prove to be correct. He also acted to weaken rival cartels and arrest their members, including the Zetas and the Beltrán Leyva Organization.The United States viewed García Luna as an important ally for years, despite growing doubts about his corruption. His lawyers have sought to be allowed to submit photographic and written evidence of meetings where he rubbed shoulders with senior US officials.","García Luna's future depends on the outcome of his currently ongoing trial. If found guilty, though, he faces a sentence of between ten years and life in prison."
"Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, alias 'The Chess Player'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/gilberto-rodriguez-orejuela-alias-the-chess-player/,Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela,The Chess Player,./images/individuals/gilberto-rodríguez-orejuela.jpg,2022-06-15,['colombia personalities'],colombia,"For more than two decades, Colombian kingpin, Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela, alias “El Ajedrecista,” meaning “The Chess Player,” was one of the leaders and founders of the now-defunct Cali Cartel, a confederation of 15 criminal groups dedicated to moving cocaine to the United States and Europe. Along with his younger brother, Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela, Gilberto came to control 80 percent of the cocaine market in the United States. But despite becoming one of the United States’ most wanted drug traffickers by 1989, Orejuela still managed to pose as a businessman in Colombia, allowing him to escape the clutches of justice.The end of Orejuela’s criminal emporium began in 1995 when he was arrested at one of his ostentatious properties in the city of Cali, the capital of Valle del Cauca department, located in southwestern Colombia. Orejuela was sentenced to 30 years in a US prison. From 2006 until his death on May 31, 2022, Orejuela served his sentence at the Butner federal prison in North Carolina.","Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela was born on January 30, 1939, in the Mariquita municipality, in the Tolima department. The infamous Colombian drug trafficker received his first salary by transporting drugs, but for licit use. When Gilberto was 13 years old, he worked as a messenger for the drugstore La Perla, cycling around his hometown to bring medicine to an elderly woman.Then his parents, a painter and a housewife decided to move to the city of Cali. There he grew up with his younger brother Miguel, who would later become his business partner. While studying at the San Luis Gonzaga school in the capital of Valle del Cauca, Gilberto also worked as a messenger for a pharmacy. There, he not only distributed drugs but also cheated on drug prices and the medical authorizations needed to sell them.Towards the seventies, El Ajedrecista took important steps into the illegal sphere, joining a group of merchants who would later form the infamous Cali Cartel, to smuggle contraband fabric and whiskey. He also got involved in the criminal gang ""Los Chemas,"" which was accused of kidnapping two foreigners from a diplomatic family in Cali.By 1975, Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela already exported large quantities of cocaine, camouflaged on thick wooden planks shipped in licit shipments from the port of Buenaventura, on Colombia’s Pacific Coast, to various warehouses and fictitious companies in the United States. In 1976, El Ajedrecista was linked to drug trafficking activities, after 290 kilos of coca paste were seized leaving Peru for Colombia.Two years later, authorities discovered a cocaine distribution network in Queens, New York, which was allegedly controlled by Rodríguez Orejuela.During the 1970s, the Colombian capo not only positioned himself in the world of drug trafficking but also expanded his licit emporium. Along with Miguel, Gilberto penetrated the legal world of capital, as a wealthy investor in different firms, banks, and companies, such as Laboratorios Kressfor, Drogas La Rebaja, Grupo Radial Colombiano, and Corporación Financiera de Boyacá, Chrysler and the First Interamericas Bank de Panamá. By the mid-1980s, under the leadership of the Rodríguez Orejuela brothers, the Cali Cartel had already managed to consolidate itself as one of the main drug trafficking organizations in the hemisphere. By that time, they had their own routes and markets, and the US and European authorities had already identified signs of their activity; Gilberto’s arrest, while with drug trafficker Jorge Luis Ochoa in Madrid, Spain at the end of 1984, was proof of this. After being locked up for more than 12 months, the government of Felipe González authorized his extradition to Colombia, and they were handed over to the authorities in 1986.Once in Colombian territory, El Ajedrecista was transferred to the Bellavista prison in Cali, where he remained for 13 months. Despite the 11th criminal judge of the Cali Circuit, Tobias Iván Posso, opening a process against Gilberto for drug trafficking, Gilberto was acquitted due to a lack of evidence in 1988 and he went back to the criminal underground.While Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela managed to resolve his judicial processes in his favor, his days of freedom were numbered. In 1995, the US Treasury Department published a list of companies whose ownership was awarded to the Rodríguez Orejuela brothers and at least a hundred were linked to the druglords. Additionally, that same year, the Search Bloc, an elite police unit formed in 1989, captured the Colombian drug trafficker in a luxurious home in Cali’s Santa Mónica neighborhood. Rodríguez Orejuela was immediately transferred to Bogotá, where he was initially sentenced to 12 years in prison, but his sentence was reduced to seven for confessing to some crimes and for good conduct.El Ajedrecista regained his freedom, but his luck changed in 2004 when the Attorney General's Office arrested him for sending 150 kilos of cocaine to the United States in 1990. The US government solicited the extradition of the Colombian kingpin, and in 2006 Gilberto was sentenced to 30 years in prison for conspiring to import cocaine into the United States and launder drug money. Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela was held at the Butner federal prison, until his death, of lymphoma of the brain, on May 31, 2022.","Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela and his brother Miguel founded the Cali Cartel, one of the most important drug trafficking organizations of the eighties and nineties. Under the brothers’ leadership, Helmer Herrera and José Santacruz Londoño, the criminal group imported at least 200 tons of cocaine to the United States, which corresponded to 80 percent of the drugs circulating in the United States. The sophisticated organization controlled all phases of the cocaine trafficking production chain, including the production, transportation, and distribution, as well as money laundering.US authorities determined that between 1990 and 1993, the Rodríguez Orejuela brothers hid at least 137 tons of cocaine in shipments of concrete poles, frozen vegetables, coffee, and ceramic tiles. The shipments moved in container ships from Colombia to South Florida, with stops in Venezuela, Panama, and Guatemala, and represented at least $1.3 billion in profits for the Cartel de Cali. Unlike other drug lords at the time, Gilberto tried to keep a low profile, mobilizing in a modest car and surrounded by a small security convoy that included women.His arrest in Spain in 1984, revealed that he also moved in European territory, where, according to Blu Radio, he posed as a businessman named Gilberto González Linares. El Ajedrecista also traveled through Latin America for leisure. In an interview with the journalist Julio Sánchez Cristo, Gilberto revealed that he frequently traveled to see his soccer team, América de Cali, play. For example, in 1984, before being detained in Spain, he flew to the city of Rio de Janeiro to watch the match between Flamengo and the América de Cali. ","Under the leadership of the Rodríguez Orejuela brothers, Herrera and Santacruz, the Cali Cartel formed alliances with national and international political figures and criminal organizations. However, by 1988, El Ajedrecista's actions and wealth had also earned him some enemies, resulting in a relentless war with the Medellín Cartel, led by Pablo Escobar.One of the Cali Cartel’s allies in this fight was the group Persecuted by Pablo Escoba (Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar - Pepes), which represented the criminal interests of those that had once been members of the Medellín Cartel, and who were now declaring war on their top leader, Escobar. By 1992, the Cali Cartel had contributed at least $30 million to the Pepes to fight the dispute with the Antioquia kingpin.Gilberto also formed alliances with European criminal organizations. In the mid-1980s, he established a system of cocaine transport and distribution in Europe through La Camorra, a mafia clan in Italy.Members of Colombia's political elite were also among the Cali Cartel’s allies. In 1995, president-elect Ernesto Samper Pizano, was accused by his opponent, Andres Pastrana Arango, of having received at least $3.7 million from the Cali Cartel to finance his campaign. Evidence of this included cassettes in which Miguel and Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela were heard admitting that they had delivered money for Samper's presidential campaign. However, the investigations advanced by judicial authorities at that time determined that there was not enough evidence of drug money sponsoring Samper's presidential campaign and that he had knowledge of this fact.One of Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela’s long-time enemies was Pablo Escobar. Although El Ajedrecista’s drug trafficking organization had cooperated with the Medellin Cartel to stabilize the drug market and divide territory in the United States for the distribution of cocaine in the early 1980s, by the end of the decade both cartels were already waging a brutal territorial struggle in Colombia. In an interview with journalist Sánchez Cristo, Gilberto said Escobar declared war in December 1987, after the Cali Cartel leader refused to terrorize the country to avoid extradition.“So Gilberto, that means you are not my friend, and since you are not my friend, then you are my enemy, and I will treat you as an enemy from now on,” Escobar told El Ajedrecista, according to the interview with Sánchez Cristo.","Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela’s arrest not only represented the decline of the Cali Cartel, but also the end of the first generation of Colombian drug trafficking, led by Cali and the Medellín Cartel. However, El Ajedrecista’s criminal career also left behind a legacy, one that illustrated how the infiltrating branches of public power could prove more strategic to drug traffickers than waging a war against the State.The structure that El Ajedrecista established within drug trafficking organizations of the late twentieth century has disappeared, and with it, the cartels' ability to control all the links of the drug trafficking chain. Hierarchical organizations, vertically integrated and with a clearly defined command structure, have become discrete, globalized networks, made up of different cells and ready to cooperate rather than enter a dispute.Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela understood that, rather than starting a war with the Colombian state, at that time focused on persecuting Pablo Escobar and endorsing his extradition, he should instead infiltrate the ttate. This is how the leader of the Cali Cartel sought to guarantee non-action by the authorities against him through the acceptance of the ruling class and access to branches of power. “We have to have a president on our side,” El Ajedrecista said when explaining his strategy to continue his drug trafficking operations.Like the drug lords that entered the country in the early 21st century, the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers did not try to enter politics but rather sought to buy their support. An example of this was the scandal that erupted involving former President Ernesto Samper, who allegedly received money from the Cali Cartel to finance his campaign.The sophisticated intelligence system employed by the Cali Cartel allowed the organization to grow stronger as state forces focused on capturing Pablo Escobar. Before being extradited to the United States, Rodríguez Orejuela revealed that he had intercepted Escobar's phones to secure his capture. “We tapped his phones, we recorded him. We have more than 500 cassettes of Pablo Escobar,” he said. That collaborative relationship with Colombian authorities opened a window of opportunity for El Ajedrecista to expand his operations as his biggest rival’s empire collapsed.Unlike the narcos of the time, Gilberto Rodríguez Orejuela tried to go unnoticed with his investments. The leader of the Cali Cartel penetrated the legal economy in various sectors through front companies and international banking. Instead of acquiring ostentatious goods, Gilberto’s financial decisions allowed El Ajedrecista to enjoy his reputation as an entrepreneur, rather than as a narco-trafficker, and enabled him to move more easily around Colombian territory.This modus operandi is similar to that of the invisible drug traffickers, which became common after the fall of the Cali Cartel. This new generation of criminals has understood that luxuries and eccentricities can become counterproductive, drawing the attention of the media and the authorities. For this reason, they choose to portray themselves as businessmen and entrepreneurs.Such is the case of Guillermo León Acevedo Giraldo, alias “Memo Fantasma,” an elusive drug trafficker and former paramilitary commander who now describes himself as a businessman and real estate investor. His low profile and entrepreneurial image allowed him to stay off the authorities’ radar for more than two decades and even rub elbows with the elites of Colombia's exclusive economic and political sectors.",
"Jobanis de Jesús Ávila Villadiego, alias ‘Chiquito Malo’",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/jobanis-de-jesus-avila-villadiego-chiquito-malo/,Jobanis de Jesús Ávila Villadiego,Chiquito Malo,./images/individuals/jobanis-de-jesús-ávila-villadiego.jpg,2022-06-17,"['colombia', 'colombia personalities', 'gaitanistas']",colombia,"Jobanis de Jesús Ávila Villadiego, alias ""Chiquito Malo,"" is the current commander of the Urabeños, one of Colombia’s most powerful groups. The group is referred to as Clan del Golfo (Gulf Clan) by authorities and calls itself as the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia – AGC). Ávila assumed leadership of the organization following the arrest of Dairo Antonio Úsuga, alias ""Otoniel,"" in October 2021.Chiquito Malo inherited a criminal organization with significant challenges. Listed among them are persecution by the authorities, open warfare with other criminal groups and weak cohesion within the organization itself. He will have to confront these challenges in order to remain pertinent on Colombia's criminal chessboard.","Chiquito Malo was born in San Pedro de Urabá, a municipality in the Antioquia department, in northern Colombia. His criminal trajectory began within the paramilitary ranks of the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC). He was part of the Banana Bloc, present in the Urabá region, until its demobilization in November 2004.He later joined the Urabeños, a group that emerged in 2006 out of the paramilitary demobilization process, in which former members decided to return to arms and control criminal economies, such as drug trafficking, in the territories previously occupied by the AUC.Due to his experience and knowledge of the Urabá area, Chiquito Malo quickly ascended within the structure. He was eventually appointed commander of the Urabá Central Structure, by which time he controlled the group's drug trafficking activities in the Gulf of Urabá, a key territory for shipping drugs to Central America and the United States.By 2015, he was considered to be one of the group's top leaders. In June of that year, the United States government issued a formal accusation, identifying him as one of the main leaders of the drug trafficking structure.That same year, after intense persecution by the Colombian authorities, Ávila Villadiego managed to escape a raid in Urabá, Antioquia, in which three men within his security team were killed and four more were captured. His whereabouts have since been unknown, but that has not affected his power. In 2018, the United States requested his extradition to the United States on drug trafficking charges.In February 2021, following the death of the second-in-command of the Urabeños, Nelson Hurtado Simanca, alias ""Marihuano,"" Chiquito Malo became Otoniel's right-hand man, the person responsible for ensuring his safety. But that didn't last long. In October 2021, Otoniel was captured and Ávila Villadiego became the head of the criminal organization.Behind him are other long-time commanders of the group, like Wilmer Giraldo, alias ""Siopas"" and José Gonzalo Sánchez, alias ""Gonzalito."" However, the extent to which he will be able to command their loyalty remains uncertain, as both of them were rumored to be vying for the top job. ","Chiquito Malo took over the Urabeños with years of experience in controlling drug trafficking in Urabá, in both Antioquia and Chocó, a region where the group has historically maintained an influence and that is key to sending drug shipments to Central America, the United States and the Caribbean.As the leader of the Urabeños, Chiquito Malo is at the helm of one of the country's largest criminal structures, which not only participates in drug trafficking, but also in other criminal economies, such as illegal mining, extortion and smuggling.He is also in charge of managing and controlling the Urabeños’ internal network of structures, substructures and franchises, which maintain a certain degree of independence from the group's central leadership. These structures are key to the group's operations and criminal profits.","Before assuming leadership of the Urabeños, Chiquito Malo’s experience was concentrated in the Urabá region, which is divided between the departments of Antioquia and Chocó, and is key to criminal economies such as drug trafficking, illegal mining, migrant smuggling and contraband.As the group’s leader, Ávila Villadiego is responsible for structures with a territorial presence in more than half of Colombia's departments. The group's greatest influence continues to be concentrated in the departments of Antioquia, Córdoba and Sucre. Nevertheless, the group still has a presence in Valle del Cauca, Bolívar, Magdalena, Cesar, Guajira, Norte de Santander and some municipalities in Nariño and Cauca. And through their franchises they have managed to participate in criminal dynamics in departments such as Meta, Casanare and Vichada. There has been speculation that Chiquito Malo will not be able to wield the same amount of authority across all Urabeños operations as his predecessor. In May 2022, following the announcement that alias ‘Otoniel’ would be extradited to the United States, Chiquito Malo declared an armed strike in Colombia. This armed strike led to violence in 178 municipalities nationwide.","As the Urabeños’ top leader, Chiquito Malo inherited allies and enemies, both domestically and internationally.The Sinaloa Cartel has been among the Urabeños' primary drug trafficking associates for years, but the Mexican cartel is not the group’s only criminal ally. The group has managed to forge and maintain criminal ties with important European mafias, like the 'Ndrangheta and Balkan gangs.These alliances require the Urabeños to control areas of cultivation, drug production and trafficking routes in Colombia, leading the group to engage in local battles over territorial control.The National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN) is the Urabeños’ primary enemy in several areas of Colombia. In the Chocó department, the groups have clashed over control drug trafficking and illegal mining territories since 2018. In Norte de Santander, both groups have been fighting for key areas along the country's border with Venezuela since the end of 2020. The Urabeños had temporarily formed an alliance with the Rastrojos in the border area to wrest territory from the ELN, but the status of said alliance is uncertain.In the northern department of Magdalena, Chiquito Malo’s men have been going head-to-head with the Pachenca since 2019. In the beginning, the Pachenca were the Urabenos’ main logistical operators for cocaine trafficking out of Colombia’s Caribbean coast, however, the Urabeños chose to dispute control of the territory and clear the way for them to dominate the area. Similarly, in the Antioquia department, the group is fighting gangs associated with the Oficina de Envigado, its former ally, for control of the routes that connect southeastern Antioquia with the Chocó department and the Colombian Pacific. In other areas of the Antioquia department, such as the north and Bajo Cauca, the Urabeños have clashed with the 18th and 36th Fronts of the ex-FARC Mafia, which have been considerably affected by the group's actions.In addition to the group's ongoing territorial wars within the country, Colombian authorities are on their heels, resulting in seizures, captures and casualties.","With just a few months at the helm of the criminal structure, Chiquito Malo's leadership faces significant challenges, both within and outside the criminal organization. Internally, he faces an atomized structure with a history of betrayals and internal divisions, which he will have to circumvent if he wants to remain relevant on the country’s criminal chessboard.Externally, criminal enemies and the Colombian and US governments have their eye on the group, with the latter focused on dismantling the criminal structure.As Otoniel’s successor, Chiquito Malo was a top target as soon as he assumed leadership of the Urabeños. A reward of five billion pesos, more than $1 million, is already posted for information leading to his whereabouts.In July 2022, the Urabeños launched a murder campaign targeting Colombian security forces, presumably on Chiquito Malo’s orders. The killings are likely aimed at keeping the group on the incoming government’s radar, as well as showing unity despite internal conflicts."
Juan Orlando Hernández,https://insightcrime.org/honduras-organized-crime-news/juan-orlando-hernandez/,Juan Orlando Hernández,,./images/individuals/juan-orlando-hernández.jpg,2022-04-20,"['honduras', 'honduras personalities', 'juan orlando hernández']",honduras,"Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, Honduras’ former president, is facing trial on US drug charges after years of allegations that he received bribes to protect traffickers, financed political campaigns with drug money and abetted his brother’s cocaine ring.A onetime US ally, Hernández was placed in shackles at his home in February 2022, a spectacular downfall for a politician who held the country’s highest office for two consecutive terms from 2014 to 2022.As head of congress and then president, Hernández was the country’s most powerful political figure for more than two decades, but his tenure was roiled by persistent accusations of corruption among members of his inner circle, including his sister and his brother, Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández, who is imprisoned in the US after being convicted of drug trafficking in 2019.US prosecutors have accused the former president of facilitating an international drug trafficking network that moved at least 500 tons of cocaine through Honduras to the United States. Hernández has repeatedly denied all drug-related accusations.","Hernández started his political career in his hometown of Gracias, in the western department of Lempira, joining the ranks of the right-wing National Party (Partido Nacional) in the 1990s. He was elected Lempira’s congressman in 1997.   In 2010, Hernández was elected President of the National Congress, cementing his rise within the ruling party. But as his power grew, he was increasingly dogged by allegations of corruption. During his tenure as head of Congress, the congressionally-controlled Departmental Development Fund misappropriated an estimated $360 million in funds, using them to fill party coffers and finance campaigns. The fund was under the stewardship of Hilda Hernández, Hernández's sister who ran Honduras’ Ministry of Social Development and Inclusion.Hernández was first elected president in 2013. Investigations by the country’s anti-corruption commission later revealed that millions of dollars in embezzled funds were funneled to Hernandez’s first presidential campaign.Hernández won a second term in 2017. His re-election, however, was marred by controversy – including the country’s Supreme Court voiding single term limits for presidents to allow him to run again – and accusations of voter fraud.At the same time, a wave of traffickers indicted in the United States began to provide testimony that implicated Hernandez in receiving bribes. Then in 2018, his brother Tony was arrested on drug charges at a Miami airport. Court documents that came to light in his brother’s case identified Hernández as being a co-conspirator.His brother’s high-profile trial in 2019 made the then-president the subject of even more damning allegations. During the trial, Alexander Ardón, a former drug trafficker and mayor, testified that Tony had traded protection for Ardón’s operations for a $2 million contribution to his brother’s campaign.US prosecutors also alleged that former Sinaloa Cartel kingpin Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" had hand-delivered $1 million to Tony that was meant for the former president.Prosecutors also spoke of a ledger confiscated from a drug trafficker that listed $440,000 in payments to ""JOH y su gente,"" or JOH and his associates. The president is commonly referenced by his initials. Usually loath to name sitting presidents in criminal indictments, US prosecutors continued to allege in various cases and his brother’s sentencing that President Hernández took bribes directly and had participated firsthand in his brother’s drug trafficking scheme. The most explosive allegation came when a witness during the 2021 trial of drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramírez testified that President Hernández had boasted about deceiving US anti-drug forces.“We are going to shove the drugs up the noses of the gringos and they won’t even know it,” the president allegedly said.Still, Hernández retained his status as a key US partner, willing to accommodate then-President Donald Trump and his crusade to stop migrants from reaching the US-Mexico border.It was only in 2021, more than a decade after repeated allegations of serious misconduct, that Washington truly began to distance itself from the Hernández administration. In February of that year, eight Democratic senators proposed a sanctions bill in which they said that Hernández had engaged in a pattern of criminal activities.By November 2021, voters in Honduras had had enough of Hernández’s ruling National Party. Xiomara Castro won a decisive victory in the presidential election, and speculation soon swirled that Hernández could be indicted by US prosecutors upon leaving office.Following the loss, Hernandez was immediately appointed to the Central American Parliament (PARLACEN) in a bid for immunity from prosecution.But just weeks after leaving office, US prosecutors asked for his extradition on drug trafficking and weapons charges. Hernández was detained at his home on February 15, 2022. Police placed him in shackles and a bulletproof vest, a shocking and once unthinkable sight.","Hernández has been accused of accepting bribes from drug traffickers, and even providing presidential protection to drug labs and cocaine shipments. He has long denied the allegations against him, saying that they are the product of traffickers with a vendetta.US prosecutors in the Southern District of New York – the same office that prosecuted his brother – brought the charges against Hernández.In early 2022, Hernández also made the State Department’s so-called Engel List of corrupt actors for “committing or facilitating acts of corruption and narco-trafficking, and using the proceeds of illicit activity to facilitate political campaigns.”While he has previously admitted receiving campaign funding from sources known to funnel misappropriated public funds, Hernández has claimed ignorance of the origin of those payments.","With the protection of the National Party, drug traffickers transformed Honduras into a major thoroughfare for South American cocaine to Mexico and the US.Western Honduras, near the Guatemala border, was the center of power for Hernández and his brother Tony, who was also a National Party congressman. There, the younger Hernández began to serve as a political powerbroker with drug trafficking clans.  Both aerial and maritime routes flourished. Clandestine landing strips for drug-flights carrying northbound cocaine became common in the more sparsely populated regions of the country. Land routes also were popular among traffickers connected to Honduras.With Tony's protection, the Valle Valle brothers controlled the principal land corridor from Honduras into Guatemala, where between 150 to 300 tons of cocaine were trafficked each year since at least 2015.","Through his brother, Hernández allegedly offered protection to some of the most prolific drug trafficking organizations in Honduras.Tony’s principal clients were the Valle Valle brothers, with whom he got his start in large-scale trafficking. Tony brokered a truce between them and the group’s biggest rival, the AA Cartel, according to court documents.Hernández allegedly provided Tony’s associates with political protection and support from authorities. This included the services of notorious former police chief Juan Carlos Bonilla Valladares, alias “El Tigre,” who is accused of using his position to protect drug shipments on behalf of Tony Hernández. During his year at the helm of the Honduran National Police, he allegedly oversaw multi-ton loads of cocaine traveling from Colombia and Venezuela on to Guatemala, according to US prosecutors. On April 8, a Honduran judge agreed to Bonilla’s extradition to the US on drug charges. Hernández was a constant scourge for the country’s opposition, having won his 2017 bid for re-election under dubious circumstances.Until 2021, however, the political opposition had remained too divided to mount a strong enough campaign to ensure his defeat. This made Xiomara Castro’s decisive victory over her National Party opponent, Nasry Asfura, all the more historic, as it ended 12 years of National Party rule.One of Hernandez’s more outspoken critics, former Security Minister Ramón Sabillón, ultimately carried out his arrest.  ","If Hernández goes to trial, he would be the first president to find himself in a US courtroom on drug charges since Panama President Manuel Noriega, who was convicted in a Florida court in April 1992.If Hernández is convicted of firearms and drug charges, he could face a sentence of life in a US prison. His brother Tony was sentenced to life in prison, as was drug trafficker Geovanny Fuentes Ramírez. In both cases, prosecutors named the former president."
"Ariel Máximo Cantero, alias 'Guille'",https://insightcrime.org/argentina-organized-crime-news/ariel-maximo-cantero-alias-guille/,Ariel Máximo Cantero,Guille,./images/individuals/ariel-máximo-cantero.jpg,2022-10-20,"['argentina', 'argentina personalities', 'los monos']",argentina,"Ariel Máximo Cantero, alias “Guille,” is the leader of the Monos, a family clan and drug gang based in Rosario, Argentina. Cantero is currently in prison. However, that has not stopped him from calling the shots from behind bars. ","Cantero, alias “Guille,” is the son of Los Monos founder, Ariel Cantero, alias “El Viejo,” and Patricia Celestina Contreras de Cantero, alias “La Cele.”Guille assumed leadership of the Monos family clan in 2013, along with his foster care brother Ramón Manchuca, alias “Monchi,” following the murder of his brother, Claudio Ariel Cantero, alias “El Pájaro.”In the wake of his brother’s murder, Cantero oversaw a wave of violence in Rosario that resulted in the local homicide rate shooting up far higher than the national average. Among those murdered immediately after El Pájaro's death was nightclub owner Diego Demarre, who Cantero and the Monos believed turned the former leader over to his assassins. Police suspected Cantero of the murder.Wanted for murder and for leading the Monos, Cantero went to the police station and asked to speak with agents saying his name was “Diego Oviedo."" However, investigators recognized him, and he was taken into custody under his real identity. Guille hoped to be released soon as he had no convictions or significant judicial record at that time. However, that was about to change.Over the next few years, Cantero was charged with drug trafficking (2015, 2018, 2019), illicit associations as the leader of the Monos (2018), homicide (2018), and kidnapping (2019).Cantero is known to use violence to intimidate authorities. In 2018, just days after Cantero was sentenced to 37 years in prison on charges of illicit association and homicide, a gunman opened fire on the former house of one of the judges. This was the first of a series of attacks against judges and judicial buildings in Rosario.In July 2020, investigators proved that Cantero threatened a judge for denying his request to be transferred to a different prison. Cantero has continued to issue orders and threats from behind bars. On August 23, 2021, a landline phone intended for all prisoners was discovered in Cantero’s cell. The line was not monitored, and his conversations were not recorded – potentially allowing the criminal leader to continue his illegal activities behind bars. The landline was removed but, two weeks later, an inspection on September 2 found that it had been replaced. Likewise, in June 2018, 42 cellphones were found in the prison wing where Cantero and other Monos members were held, an area only accessible by prison personnel.The threats continued in 2021, in the lead-up to the court decision regarding Cantero's role in ordering the 2018 attacks. Santa Fe's 911 line received an anonymous phone call in early September, saying ""Release the Canteros, free the Monos or we will kill all the prosecutors."" Then, on August 18, the day before the trial began, two gunmen opened fire on the courthouse - the very sort of attack that the Monos leader has been charged with ordering in 2018.The murder rate also spiked around this time. Rosario saw six homicides in a 24-hour period between September 6 and 7. On September 30, 2021, Cantero was sentenced to 22 more years for ordering the 2018 attacks on the homes of judicial officials and buildings. Since then, however, Cantero's control of the Monos does not appear to have waned. His family remains firmly in control of the gang, as evidenced by the arrest of his younger brother, Dylan, in September 2022. ","In addition to the Monos’ regular drug sale activities, Cantero has turned violence into one of the group’s most profitable criminal activities. Through threats, extortion and usurpations, he has reportedly amassed more than 150 properties. For example, businessman Leonardo Peiti, handed his clandestine casinos over to Cantero upon receiving death threats.Since 2013, Cantero has managed to continue issuing orders from behind bars – a capacity that Cantero has publicly flaunted despite being transferred to six different prisons. When asked to declare his profession during a recent court hearing, Cantero boldly responded: “I hire hitmen to shoot judges.”  Prosecutors have proven that Cantero has used WhatsApp to coordinate attacks from behind bars, and in 2021 a landline phone was twice discovered in Cantero’s cell. Cantero is also known to have used “paid visitors” to communicate orders.","Cantero grew up in the La Granada neighborhood in the southern part of Rosario, in Argentina’s Santa Fe province. Los Monos have operated in the city of Rosario, Argentina’s third most populous city, for more than 20 years. Located on the west bank of the Paraná River, Rosario is a transit point for drug and contraband shipments coming from neighboring Bolivia and Paraguay.Cantero is currently being held in the Marcos Paz Federal Penitentiary in Buenos Aires.","Cantero counts corrupt public officials among his allies, as demonstrated by the ease with which he has managed to access phones within the prison. Additionally, with the help of his right-hand man, Brandon Baya, Cantero has also formed alliances with other gangs in neighboring cities, such as San Lorenzo, Capitán Bermúdez and Granadero Baigorria.Cantero has also accrued many enemies. Cantero’s archenemy is rival Rosario-based drug trafficker Esteban Alvarado, who is also behind bars at the Marcos Paz Federal Penitentiary. Both Cantero and Alvarado are known to try to incriminate the other in different crimes with the help of complicit police. A division of the judicial police even reportedly aimed to take out Cantero to facilitate a territorial takeover by Alvarado’s group.  Guille’s arrest, along with the arrests of other key members of the Monos, gave rise to a power struggle with other local gangs, such as the Funes and the Ungaro, over the control of street-level drug sales.","With seven sentences for different crimes – Cantero has already accumulated more than 83 years of prison time. While Guille’s prison sentence is likely to keep getting longer, that alone is not going to be enough to reign in his influence over Rosario’s criminal landscape. As long as Cantero can keep issuing orders from behind bars, he will continue to pose a major threat to security in Rosario."
Pablo Escobar,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/pablo-escobar/,Pablo Escobar,,./images/individuals/pablo-escobar.jpg,2021-08-30,"['auc', 'bolivia', 'cocaine', 'colombia', 'colombia personalities', 'don berna', 'eln', 'narcoculture', 'oficina de envigado', 'panama', 'peru', 'usa']",peru,"Pablo Emilio Escobar Gaviria was the pioneer in industrial-scale cocaine trafficking. Known as “El Patrón,” Escobar led the Medellín Cartel from the 1970s to the early 1990s. He oversaw each step of cocaine production, from sourcing coca base paste in Andean nations to feeding a booming US market for the drug. He also successfully challenged the State on extradition, showing that extreme violence could force governments to negotiate.","Like most of his partners in the Medellín Cartel, Escobar came from a humble social background. He dropped out of school because his family could not pay for his education and soon got involved in petty crime. His early criminal activities included smuggling stereo equipment and stealing tombstones to resell them.Escobar then entered the cocaine trade, founding the Medellín Cartel in the 1970s and the Ochoa Vásquez brothers (Jorge Luis, Juan David and Fabio). The Ochoa brothers were initially the business brains of the outfit. Meanwhile, Escobar first oversaw the group's ""protection"" before emerging as its undisputed leader.During the Medellín Cartel’s zenith in the 1980s and early 1990s, Escobar controlled nearly the entire cocaine supply chain. He oversaw the import of large, multi-ton shipments of coca base from Andean nations Peru and Bolivia into Colombia, where it was processed into cocaine in jungle labs. The criminal enterprise then stored the drug in Colombia before flying it to the United States. In the 1980s, the organization is estimated to have supplied over 80 percent of all cocaine shipped to the country, sending across some 15 tons per day.In this period, kidnappings made by guerrilla groups led the State to collaborate with criminal groups. The 1981 kidnapping of the sister of the Ochoas led to the creation of a Medellín Cartel-funded paramilitary group known as Death to Kidnappers (Muerte a Secuestradores - MAS). In the mid-1980s, Escobar’s hold on Medellín increased when he founded a criminal debt collection service known as the “Oficina de Envigado.” This was an office in the town hall of Envigado, a small municipality next to Medellín where Escobar grew up. Escobar used the municipal office to collect debts owed to him by drug traffickers and set the “sicarios” or hired killers on those who refused.Unlike many drug traffickers today, Escobar was not afraid to flaunt his riches. His cartel is estimated to have earned around $420 million in revenue per week during the mid-1980s, and Escobar himself made Forbes' Billionaires list for seven years straight, between 1987 to 1993. His luxurious multimillion-dollar ""Hacienda Nápoles"" estate had its own zoo, and he reportedly ate from solid gold dinner sets. Despite his opulent lifestyle, Escobar presented himself as a populist figure, persecuted by the upper classes for his own social background and efforts to help the poor. He attempted to stir up anti-establishment sentiment and win over disadvantaged communities by opening a public zoo, constructing 70 community soccer fields and building housing for the poor.He could not break into Medellín's upper social classes, which blocked his application to join the city's top social club. His attempts to join the political elite were also crushed in the early 1980s when he was expelled from Colombia's Liberal Party and thrown out of his position as a deputy congressman.These tensions escalated in the mid-1980s when the Medellín Cartel declared war on the Colombian state. In April 1984, the nation's then Justice Minister Rodrigo Lara Bonilla was shot dead by sicarios working for Escobar. The Colombian state responded by immediately signing into law Escobar's extradition to the United States. In response, Escobar's hitmen murdered dozens of judges, police and several journalists in the late 1980s. During the 1989 presidential elections, Escobar's assassins murdered the Liberal Party candidate Luis Carlos Galán Sarmiento. They then made a failed attempt to kill Galán's replacement, Liberal Party presidential candidate César Augusto Gaviria Trujillo. Using these tactics, Escobar eventually pushed the State to ban the extradition of Colombian nationals in the 1991 Constitutional Assembly. He managed to negotiate his surrender to authorities and took up residence in a jail known as the “Cathedral,” which he built. It was a jail only in name. Escobar controlled the guards and had a playhouse built on the grounds for when his daughter went to visit. He used his first year behind bars to reorganize the Medellín Cartel.But his influence in the organization was dwindling. Resentment against Escobar grew when he raised a ""tax"" on cartel members, making them pay between $200,000 and $1 million in fees. And in July 1992, Escobar's men found a stash of $20 million on a property belonging to cartel member Fernando Galeano. Escobar summoned Galeano and another associate, Gerardo Moncada, for a meeting at the Cathedral. Both were then killed by two of Escobar's sicarios.On hearing of the killings, President César Gaviria ordered for Escobar to be sent from the Cathedral to a military base in Colombia’s capital, Bogotá. Before he could be transferred, Escobar escaped.Ultimately, Escobar's former criminal associates teamed up with the government and gradually dismantled his empire. Out of money, luck, and with just one bodyguard left, authorities in Colombia gunned down Escobar on the rooftop of a house in Medellín on December 2, 1993.Rumors have circulated for years around his death. Former paramilitary leader and mafia boss Diego Fernando Murillo Bejarano, alias ""Don Berna,"" claimed his brother fired Escobar's shot.","Escobar was instrumental in setting up the Medellín Cartel, feeding booming demand in the United States during the 1980s.Through the 1980s and early 1990s, Escobar oversaw each step of the cocaine supply chain as the Medellín Cartel's undisputed leader. The organization sourced coca leaf from primary production points in Peru and Bolivia, processed it in Colombian jungle labs, then shipped cocaine to the United States, where operatives sold it on the streets.He focused on international markets for cocaine and never sold the drug domestically to Colombians for consumption. Instead, Escobar initially used a Caribbean air route to feed the US market.Escobar also ordered contract killings to target police, judges, politicians and journalists. On the other hand, the Medellín Cartel maintained high-level allies in security and justice institutions that largely protected its members from prosecution.He dipped into extortion, too. While he was at the ""Cathedral,"" he made his money by shaking down other drug traffickers, who had to pay him a fixed sum every month.Finally, Escobar was known for investing profits from the drug trade in luxury goods, property, and works of art. He is also reported to have stashed his cash in “hidden coves,” allegedly burying it on his farms and under floors in many of his houses. ","Escobar headed the Medellín Cartel, named after the Colombian city where it was based. However, his influence extended to as far as the United States, where he ran distribution networks.Medellín has paid a high cost in blood for its role in the international cocaine trade. The city's murder rate was the highest in the world during Escobar's day.To ensure the smooth transfer of cocaine from coca leaf to consumer, Escobar’s ties extended to Andean production nations (including Bolivia, Peru) and the United States and Canada.He also sought refuge in Panama – a nation the Medellín Cartel appears to have passed drugs en route to the United States - when Colombian authorities attempted to capture him.","Escobar’s success in the underworld relied on alliances far and wide. His actions, wealth and public profile also meant he had many enemies, whose eventual alliance would ultimately lead to his downfall.The Ochoa Vásquez brothers (Jorge Luis, Juan David and Fabio) were close allies of Escobar for years. They helped form the Medellín Cartel and worked for hand in hand with the drug lord to run the organization. Others, such as José Gonzalo Rodríguez Gacha, alias ""El Mexicano,"" also worked with Escobar to provide the organization with muscle and logistical support.Escobar also maintained alliances with associates based in Andean production nations. Jorge Roca Suárez, alias “Techo de Paja,” was identified as having provided cocaine shipments to Escobar and his uncle Roberto Suárez Gómez, known as the “King of Cocaine” in Bolivia.The Medellín Cartel also formed alliances with Mexican groups to traffic cocaine into the United States. Escobar allied with leader of the Juárez Cartel, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""El Señor de los Cielos,"" or ""Lord of the Skies."" Carrillo Fuentes used his fleet of aircraft to transport drugs belonging to Escobar as part of the Guadalajara Cartel.One of Escobar's most consistent enemies was the Cali Cartel. The Cali Cartelinitially cooperated with the Medellín Cartel during the early 1980s to stabilize the drug market and divide territory in the United States. However, by 1988 the cartels were fighting a vicious turf war in Colombia. The Cali Cartel ultimately funded elements of the Medellín Cartel that turned against Escobar after the 1992 murders of Galeano and Moncada in the Cathedral. They attacked Escobar's support structure by calling themselves the People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar (Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar - PEPES. One Cali Cartel leader, Francisco Hélmer Herrera Buitrago, alias ""Pacho,"" claimed that he personally invested $30 million in the war against Escobar. The PEPES' principal objective was to hunt down Escobar. The PEPES worked with and were protected by the State.PEPES membership included the founders of what became the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC): the brothers Fidel Antonio Castaño Gil, alias ""Rambo,"" Carlos Castaño Gil, and José Vicente Castaño Gil, alias ""El Profe,"" as well as ""Don Berna,"" who joined the AUC later. Former allies of Escobar, the Castaños grew distant from him for many reasons. These included his stated affinity for left-wing guerrillas, his alleged links to the M-19 rebel movement and the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN).Meanwhile, Don Berna turned on Escobar after El Patrón killed his boss, Fernando Galeano. Don Berna and his PEPES associates tracked down Escobar's family and connections, killing many of them. The police used Don Berna for information, leading to the capture of several Escobar associates, seizure of properties, and freezing his bank accounts. Don Berna claimed he and other members of PEPES were with the police that located Escobar on the day of his death.To bring down Escobar, the PEPES worked alongside the Search Bloc, an elite police unit formed in 1989 made up of around 600 members and based out of the Carlos Holguín Police School in Medellín. When Escobar surrendered in 1991, its members were dispersed. It reformed following his escape from prison in 1992 and hunted him until his death in 1993.","Escobar's death signaled the end of one era of drug trafficking and the birth of another. Mystique surrounding the drug lord has grown since 1993, and endless myths have circulated.The Medellín Cartel no longer exists, nor does the cartel structure Escobar help to found, which involved controlling all the links in the drug chain from production to retail.While the Colombian department of Antioquia, of which Medellín is the capital, remains pivotal to the nation’s cocaine trade, today's drug lords bear little resemblance to Escobar. Following Escobar’s downfall, the structure of Colombia’s underworld -- and Medellín's especially – shifted. It gradually went from being hierarchical and dominated by a few key actors to more federal, fragmented and horizontal. The ""Oficina"" - which had its roots in Envigado - transformed into a mafia federation that now regulates almost all criminal activity in Medellín.A modern-day counterpart to Escobar himself is hard to come by. There is no single figure able to exercise control even in Medellín today, let alone over a large portion of the international cocaine trade. Instead, a given figure climbs up the ladder, is often quickly identified by authorities and captured. Today, Escobar’s closest counterparts would be the Mexican capos.Since Escobar, a new generation of “Invisible” traffickers has emerged. They have learned that demonstrating a luxury lifestyle and using extreme public violence is counterproductive. Instead, anonymity is their protection plan. This new generation of drug traffickers looks like young entrepreneurs or highly qualified businessmen. They are unrecognizable from those who dominated in Escobar’s day.With this, the ""man of the people"" model traffickers like Escobar traditionally tried to transmit is dying out. Mexican trafficker Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Chapo"" operated using this approach and Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias ""El Mencho"" has replicated it to a certain extent. But now, criminal governance and loyalty are largely being cultivated at the group level, not by individual leaders.Escobar achieved a level of state penetration which helped members of his cartel to avoid capture for years. The fact he was elected to Congress as an alternate tells us about how deeply he could achieve this. Drug traffickers still have links to state institutions. Political elites have been historically linked to drug trafficking and corruption. Other institutions continue to be penetrated at a more local level. The Urabeños, one of Colombia's most influential criminal groups, for example, have worked through corruption networks linked to local governments in Colombia.The US Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act may also be considered as another legacy of Escobar's influence. Made law in 1999, it permits ""the identification of and worldwide sanctions against foreign narcotics traffickers whose activities threaten US security, foreign policy, or the economy."" Its purpose is to prevent foreign drug traffickers from trading with US companies or individuals. Finally, Escobar remains a contemporary narcoculture symbol, the “kingpin” in the popular imagination. His name is often used to refer to drug lords that have cornered the drug market in certain Latin American countries. However, few – if any – have ever built a cocaine empire to rival Escobar, who continues to inspire numerous books and television shows, with his face even stamped on to drug packets."
"Jimmy Chérizier, alias 'Barbecue'",https://insightcrime.org/caribbean-organized-crime-news/jimmy-cherizier-alias-barbecue/,Jimmy Chérizier,Barbecue,./images/individuals/jimmy-chérizier.jpg,2022-10-20,"['caribbean', 'haiti', 'haiti personalities']",haiti,"Former police officer Jimmy Chérizier, alias ""Barbecue,"" is one of Haiti’s most important gang leaders. He is best known for establishing the “G9 and Family” (G9 an fanmi – G9), a criminal federation of nine of the strongest gangs in Haiti’s capital of Port-au-Prince.Barbecue has collaborated with the ruling Haitian Tèt Kale Party (Parti Haïtien Tèt Kale – PHTK) and police. But more recently, he posed challenges to the Haitian state, calling for revolution in June 2021 and demanding the resignation of interim President Ariel Henry. He continues positioning himself to take advantage of a power vacuum left by former President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination, through an alliance with political elites formerly aligned with Moïse.","Barbecue’s criminal career dates back to at least 2017, during his time as a police officer.He came on to the map in November 2017, when he participated in a supposed anti-gang operation that led to the extrajudicial killing of at least 9 innocent civilians in the Grand Ravine neighborhood of Port-au-Prince.A year later, Barbecue allegedly participated in the La Saline Massacre with his Delmas 6 gang, the Cité Soleil gang, Baz Pilate and Ti Bwa. Witnesses reported he was spotted talking with former government official, Joseph Pierre Richard Duplan and other gang leaders during the attack.This was the worst massacre to rock Haiti in more than a decade, with at least 71 people killed. Barbecue was fired a month later, and a warrant was issued for his arrest.However, he evaded capture and participated in a four-day attack across Port-au-Prince's Bel-Air neighborhood in November 2019. Barbecue and members of four gangs -- Delmas 6, Base Nan Chabon, Krache Dife and the St Martin Street Gang – set houses ablaze and killed at least 24 people.Ahead of these massacres, Barbecue received material, logistical and financial support from senior officials in the government of President Jovenel Moïse. He received money, weapons, police uniforms, and government vehicles to carry out the attacks.A senior government official told InSight Crime that before Jovenel Moïse’s assassination, 50 percent of the G9’s funding came from government money, 30 percent from kidnappings and 20 percent from extortion. However, after the killing, government funding dropped by 30 percent.The massacres - which largely targeted opposition neighborhoods across Haiti's capital - served mutual benefits for senior state officials and Barbecue. The government could crack down on opposition strongholds. Meanwhile, Barbecue could increase his influence as leader of the Delmas 6 gang, a role he has repeatedly denied.At the time, Moïse faced constant protests demanding his resignation. Haitians blamed him for the nation's ongoing economic crisis, rampant corruption, gasoline shortages, and rising violence.Before the creation of the G9 in 2020, Barbecue had become powerful enough to take over duties assigned to the police. Less than 24 hours after an anti-gang operation in Village de Dieu was announced by the Minister of Justice and Public Security, Joseph Jouthe, Barbecue claimed that him and other 19 police officers could clean up the Village de Dieu community.In May 2020, Barbecue was linked to further attacks in the capital. He and allied gang leaders allegedly close to the government held a “preparatory meeting” to “organize simultaneous attacks” across several Port-au-Prince neighborhoods, Haiti’s National Human Rights Defense Network (Réseau National de Défense des Droits de l'Homme -- RNDDH) revealed.Days later, Barbecue and a number of gangs he had united attacked the Pont-Rouge, Chancerelles, La Saline and Fort Dimanche neighborhoods to expand territorial control, with the support of national police. A number of individuals were burned and shot to death, and scores of houses were incinerated.The attacks were an immediate precursor to the G9 and Family's formation, which Barbecue announced in a video uploaded to YouTube in June 2020. He presented the gang alliance to restore peace across Port-au-Prince. Instead, the coalition has allowed gangs to expand territorial control and offered politicians a unified weapon to stamp out opposition.Barbecue has faced several challenges as the coalition's leader. One of these has been internal clashes. In mid-2021, he played peacemaker after the Grand Ravine gang launched attacks on the neighborhood of Ti Bwa, which is controlled by the gang of Chrisla.Tensions between the G9 and Family and state officials have also risen. In late June 2021, Barbecue and his men marched through the streets of La Saline, brandishing weapons they had previously kept hidden.Barbecue then called for revolution against the opposition, business sector and ruling party in a video, flanked by dozens of heavily armed masked men. He later added that he and his allies were “ready for war.”On July 7, 2021, Barbecue and the G9 faced a turning point when their alleged political sponsor, President Jovenel Moïse, was assassinated in his private residence.Days later, Barbecue marched down the streets of the Lower Delmas district of Port-au-Prince with hundreds of people, to honor Moïse.He has since taken advantage of the power vacuum that has been left behind. ""Everyone needs to wait on my order before we respond to the killing of Jovenel Moïse,” he said during the march.In October 2021, he forced acting Prime Minister Ariel Henry to flee from the scene of a ceremony, which Barbecue officiated surrounded by armed gunmen.In November 2021, Barbecue and G9 led a blockade of Terminal Varreux, Haiti’s largest oil terminal. The blockade was part of a coordinated effort by criminal groups to restrict access to fuel across Haiti to destabilize the government. The chaos and shortages which followed the blockade crisis demonstrated just how much power Haiti’s gangs had accumulated.Barbecue returned to the headlines in May 2022, when a brutal 12-day gang war erupted in the northern communes of Port-au-Prince. Haiti’s single largest gang, 400 Mawozo, invaded the Cul-de-Sac plain neighborhood, a sector controlled by G9. Within hours of the attack, Barbecue and hundreds of his men swarmed the neighborhood to fend off 400 Mawozo.Barbecue has been a centerpiece of proposed sanctions from countries around the region. In 2020, the US Treasury Department placed sanctions on the gang leader, and in September 2022, the Dominican Republic banned a range of Haitian criminal figures from entering the country, including Barbeque.In October 2022, Barbecue was a central target of potential UN Security Council sanctions, after Barbecue and G9 fighters blocked the entrance to Terminal Varreux for the second time in less than a year, once again catalyzing a massive fuel crisis and paralyzing the country’s economy.","Barbecue's main role in Haiti's criminal landscape has been to lead the G9 gang alliance.He has stepped in as a peacemaker to quell internal divisions and mobilized gangs to commit targeted killings. He has long acted as a bridge between the capital's gangs and state officials, allegedly bringing both parties together to commit state-sponsored massacres.Member gangs of the G9 and Family are largely focused on extortion. They take “protection payments” from local businesses, street vendor stands, and public transportation drivers. They also carry out kidnappings for ransom. In other cases, the gangs have taken over public services such as electricity or water provision for payment.Members of the alliance may also be involved in regional arms trafficking, although this remains unclear. Previously, state officials have provided gangs with weapons to carry out targeted massacres. Barbecue has been a key intermediary in this process.With Barbecue at the helm, G9 has been linked to the ruling Haitian Tèt Kale Party (Parti Haïtien Tèt Kale – PHTK), while the gang’s rival, G-PEP, is broadly supported by PHTK's political opponents. Since the assassination of Moïse, Barbecue cut ties with the PHTK and has gained significant political capital in the areas of Port-au-Prince G9 controls.Not only has Barbecue cast himself as a defender of the former president's legacy, but he has outright rejected Henry’s legitimacy, consistently demanding his resignation. The blockades of Terminal Varreux, prolonged war with G-PEP, and rampant violence have increasingly destabilized Henry’s government, and have led Barbecue to be sanctioned by several governments.","Barbecue’s activities have largely been concentrated in neighborhoods across Haiti’s capital of Port-au-Prince, through his role as the G9’s leader. However, the extent of his geographical reach is unknown.The city's Lower Delmas neighborhood has long been a stronghold for Barbecue. It is home to his Delmas 6 gang.His influence across the capital has grown in recent years, as member gangs of the G9 have expanded their territorial control. For example, after the Pont-Rouge massacre in May 2020, the Waf Jérémie neighborhood in the center of Port-au-Prince became the coalition's operational base.The G9 reportedly occupies a few other neighborhoods under Barbecue. These include the Belecourt sector of the Cité Soleil district of Port-au-Prince, the Chancerelles, Delmas, La Saline, Martissant and Pont-Rouge neighborhoods, the Fontamara suburb of Port-au-Prince, the Waf Jérémie slum, as well as Rue Saint-Martin and Rue Porcelaine.Local media outlets have also reported that the G9 maintains control of Belekou in the Cité Soleil district of Port-au-Prince, the Grand Ravine commune, and the Village de Dieu.G9 also controls Cul-de-Sac plain, an area southwest of Croix-des-Bouquets, a neighborhood controlled by 400 Mawozo. In April 2022, G9 suffered an attack on the vast area from 400 Mowozo, but in a 12-day gang war, Barbecue and his men held off the offensive.Reports have suggested that the coalition intends to expand into other parts of Haiti with Barbecue at the helm.","As leader of the G9 and Family, Barbecue relies on the support of several powerful allies.“With all the power he has, everyone would want him on their side,” a local community leader from an area of Port-au-Prince where the G9 alliance is active told InSight Crime on the condition of anonymity.Other G9 gang leaders have acted as his principal allies. These have included James Alexander, alias ""Sonson,” of the Baz Krache Dife gang; Ezeckiel Alexandre of the Baz Pilate gang; Christ Roy Chery, alias “Krisla,” of the Nan Ti Bwa gang; Albert Stevenson, alias “Djouma,” of the Simon Pelé's gang (now arrested); Serge Alectis, alias “Ti Junior,” of the Baz Nan Chabon gang; Jean Emiliano Micanor, alias ""Micano,"" of the Waf Jérémie gang; Cendy Marcellin, alias ""Zoé,"" of the Nan Boston gang; Andris Icard, alias “Iska,” of the Belekou gang.Barbecue has worked closely with these leaders to achieve territorial expansion and attack rivals.Eleven other criminal organizations in Port-au-Prince also maintain friendly relations with the G9. They provide support to Barbecue and other gang leaders when necessary. This union is sometimes referred to as the G20.Beyond the slums of Port-au-Prince, Barbecue has allies in high places. He was previously linked to assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and the ruling PHTK party.Under Barbecue, the G9 is alleged to have ensured votes and quelled social unrest. In return, state officials are suspected to have granted members of the G9 immunity from law enforcement. Even after Moïse’s assassination, Barbecue is still likely to maintain some of these ties.Paid only $200 a month which often arrives late, many active police officers choose to join the G9 and work for Barbecue, who pays them $1,000 every month, according to a senior government official in Haiti. They reportedly facilitate his travel and ensure his safety, including during the course of criminal activities.He is also well-positioned to work with new allies if the G9 is to expand. The 400 Mawozo gang of the Ganthier commune in central Haiti and the Savien Gang of the northern Artibonite Department of Haiti could be useful allies.Barbecue’s power and public profile also mean he has a few enemies. These have evolved over the years.As a consequence of the creation of the G9, alias “Gabriel,” created the GPEP in November 2020. The GPEP is a gang alliance that represents the political opposition: some of its members are the gangs of Bel-Air, Grand Ravine, and Cité Soleil. Gabriel and Barbecue are sworn enemies.While Barbecue used to maintain close ties with the nation’s ruling party, in June 2021 he called for a revolution against them, the opposition and the business sector.Pro-opposition gangs and their leaders have also shared hostile relations with Barbecue. Battles have regularly ensued between Barbecue’s men and rival groups. For example, in May 2020, Barbecue attacked the Cité Soleil-based Fanmi Lavalas in a multi-gang assault.Barbecue might also count former members of the G9 as enemies. The Grand Ravine gang reportedly left the alliance in early 2021, as a result of internal clashes. In October 2020, the gang's leader appeared on a radio broadcast, saying he kidnapped a top lottery executive because Barbecue was not providing for him financially.","Barbecue no longer enjoys immunity nor the protection of his political godfather, Jovenel Moïse. Even though he appears to have gained more power after the creation of the G9 gang alliance, he has gained enemies as well. His prospects could go one of two ways.The creation of the G9 has given Barbecue enough power and independence to become an influential criminal leader in the political scenario.As Barbecue aims to change his criminal reputation into a revolutionary one, he might gain legitimacy and with it, leaders of the political and economic elite could become his enemies.His statement in another video shared by a local media outlet is no different, except for the active police officer that accompanies him in this apparition; “Today, at this very moment, I was in the streets because the revolution to free the country has started (at this moment police in gear appears). We also greet the policemen who are joining the movement.”Barbecue’s attempt to make of the G9 a revolutionary movement rather than a criminal one illustrates how gangs have become more autonomous from the political elite.  However, with his godfather Jovenel Moise out of the radar, his political allies are less; in fact, even the economic elite has put a price on his head. While Barbecue’s true political intentions are unknown, he now has significant power in the formal political system. With the support of voters in the areas of the city that Barbecue controls, he could feasibly run for a parliament seat in the future, securing him immunity for crimes. Targeting of key pieces of infrastructure, such as Terminal Varreux, around Port-au-Prince means Barbecue has several bargaining chips in negotiations with the government, awarding him significant political leverage."
"César Emilio Peralta, alias ‘El Abusador’",https://insightcrime.org/caribbean-organized-crime-news/cesar-emilio-peralta-alias-el-abusador/,César Emilio Peralta,El Abusador,./images/individuals/césar-emilio-peralta.jpg,2022-07-29,"['caribbean', 'cocaine', 'dominican republic', 'dominican republic personalities']",dominican,"César Emilio Peralta, alias “El Abusador,” is one of the Dominican Republic's most notorious drug traffickers. Heading up his own network, Peralta rose from being a small-scale distributor in the 1990s to one of the Caribbean’s most important cocaine traffickers by the mid-2010s. He linked South American suppliers to distributors in Puerto Rico and the US mainland.Enjoying strong political connections, allegedly including former Dominican president Danilo Medina Sánchez (2012 – 2020), Peralta’s network also became involved in heroin trafficking, human trafficking and money laundering. He was captured in December 2019 in the city of Cartagena, Colombia, after attracting the attention of US authorities and faces likely extradition to the United States. ","Peralta began working as a low-level domestic drug distributor in the 1990s. He began his career working for drug trafficking gangs led by major Dominican drug traffickers including Rolando Florían Féliz, Pascual Cordero Martínez, alias “El Chino,” Manuel Emilio Mesa Beltré, alias “El Gringo,” and Quirino Ernesto Paulino Castillo. He was arrested on drug-related charges in 2001, 2007 and 2008, yet quickly released each time. His 2008 arrest was in relation to a 258 kilogram shipment of cocaine seized in the Dominican Republic's southern province of Peravia.Up until 2013, Dominican authorities still regarded him as a “small-scale distributor,” working on behalf of other traffickers. But after the capture of ""El Chino"" in late 2015 and ""El Gringo"" in early 2016, Peralta stepped up to become one of the Caribbean's main traffickers. As he ascended to a leadership role, the Dominican Republic was becoming a key hub for US-bound drugs moving via the Caribbean route which had reacquired its importance. Taking over his bosses’ contacts, Peralta’s network began receiving shipments of Colombian cocaine and heroin from Venezuela, which he then sent to Puerto Rico and the US mainland from the Dominican Republic. By 2017, Peralta was allegedly transporting up to 20 kilograms of cocaine weekly from the Dominican Republic to Puerto Rico by plane, while also sending the drug to Miami by sea.This success, however, rapidly put him on the radar of US law enforcement officials. In April 2019, Peralta was indicted by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. On August 20, 2019, he was also designated as the leader of an international drug trafficking organization by the US Treasury Department under the Kingpin Act. On the same day, a team of over 700 soldiers, police officers and prosecutors were deployed in a mass operation, which led to the arrests of three of his lieutenants in the Dominican Republic. Peralta himself is believed to have fled to Colombia that month, where he was arrested in Cartagena in December 2019.He was in prison in Colombia's capital city of Bogotá until December 2021 when he was extradited to Puerto Rico.","Peralta's organization appears to have consisted of a small hierarchical core within a looser network. It was involved in three main criminal pursuits: drug trafficking, money laundering and human trafficking.The organization smuggled Colombian cocaine and heroin from Colombia and Venezuela to the Dominican Republic. The drug was then sent to Puerto Rico and the US mainland. Between 2008 and 2017 Peralta allegedly trafficked at least 1,120 kilograms of cocaine to Puerto Rico and the US mainland, though many believe the total amount trafficked was likely much higher.To launder his illicit earnings, Peralta used front men to control a diverse portfolio of businesses, real estate and luxury goods. This operation became extensive enough that his organization created a money laundering division made up of at least 23 family members and associates who moved? laundered? around $60 million, according to documents from the Dominican Republic's Attorney General's Office seen by InSight Crime.With an affiliate, Peralta also worked through a separate money laundering network which allegedly laundered over $260 million between 2017 and 2020.This led to the Peralta Drug Trafficking Organization (Peralta DTO) running or cooperating with a human trafficking network. The network allegedly sent women from Colombia and Venezuela to the Dominican Republic to work in several large nightclubs the group used to launder money. According to media outlet Listín Diario, citing a senior Cartagena police official, Colombian authorities believe Peralta also had operations exploiting women in Colombia.Peralta’s participation in these criminal economies was underpinned by corruption. His organization included several former military officers and he allegedly paid off at least one Dominican politician. In an intercepted phone call, Peralta also stated that he had contributed millions to the electoral campaign of former Dominican president Danilo Medina Sánchez. Medina acknowledged that he had received campaign contributions from Peralta, but claimed he did not know the money had come from drug trafficking.","Both Peralta and the Peralta DTO were based in the Dominican Republic's capital city of Santo Domingo. Besides sending drugs from South America to Puerto Rico and the US mainland, Peralta’s network was involved in wholesale distribution across the Dominican Republic.He is also reported to have used other Caribbean islands such as Antigua, Barbados and St. Maarten for his operations, though it remains unclear if his network maintained a permanent presence there. Peralta relocated to Colombia after pressure from authorities started to increase in 2019. He is believed to have been based in the country – first in Barranquilla, then Cartagena - for three months prior to his arrest in December 2019.","Like many Dominican drug trafficking organizations, Peralta’s network operated independently of any large transnational crime group. It relied on a small circle of partners and contractors to traffic drugs and launder money, while favoring cooperation with prospective competitors over violence.As such, he had more ""business associates"" than allies or enemies per se.Domestically, he maintained ties to some of the country’s most infamous drug traffickers, including Ramón Antonio del Rosario Puente, leader of the Cártel del Este, a trafficking group based in the eastern part of the Dominican Republic. He also had ties to Sergio Gómez Díaz, an affiliated trafficker linked to Colombia’s Norte del Valle Cartel.Peralta has also been linked to intermediaries with strong ties to political elites in Venezuela, a country he received drug shipments from. A yacht belonging to Venezuelan businessman Francisco Enrique Flores Suárez was found in the Dominican Republic carrying 52 kilograms of cocaine which were thought to belong to Peralta. According to Colombian authorities, Peralta was once connected to the Urabeños in Colombia. However, this relationship is thought to have soured. Before his December 2019 arrest in Cartagena, Peralta and his henchmen had allegedly been hiding from both law enforcement officials and Urabeños hitmen in Barranquilla. He was also linked to the possibly defunct Curicheros, an organization formerly based in Colombia's northeastern department of La Guajira. ","Peralta’s future prospects are poor. Political protection was likely key to his ability to work in the cocaine trade for over two decades. Yet since US authorities designated him a major drug trafficker under the Kingpin Act, his political patrons will have hastened to sever all ties to him.Meanwhile, the judicial case against 23 people accused of laundering drug profits for Peralta, including his wife, is ongoing in the Dominican Republic. Peralta was extradited to Puerto Rico in December 2021 to face charges of drug trafficking. As for his routes, contractors and contacts, it is likely that other traffickers will step into the power vacuum Peralta left behind and resume operations in the Dominican Republic just like he did.

However, there is credible information that he may be currently based in Apure, Venezuela. ","Erlinto joined the ELN around 1975 and rose through the ranks quickly. By 1980, he was part of the guerrilla group's Central Command (COCE). After longtime ELN leader Manuel Perez, alias ""El Cura,"" died, Erlinto became the military commander of the ELN. He is considered one of the group's hardliners and is responsible for trying to upgrade the ELN's military capabilities.Despite his reputation, Erlinto has been tapped to be the ELN's official spokesman during several different peace negotiations between the group and the government. In February 1999, Erlinto and Victor G. Ricardo, then Colombia’s High Commissioner for Peace, met in Caracas to discuss the final arrangements for the National Convention that was to be held that year in Colombia. The ELN requested the demilitarization of three municipalities for a “Meeting Zone” for a constitutional convention, but negotiations failed. In 2000, Erlinto met in Geneva with the government’s new peace commissioner, Camilo Gomez, but once again peace talks were suspended when Erlinto accused the government of supporting paramilitary groups.In early 2015, Erlinto announced alongside ELN supreme commander Nicolas Rodríguez Bautista, alias “Gabino,” that the guerrilla group would be willing to consider giving up the armed struggle in order to facilitate a peace process with the government.In 2018, he went to Cuba first to engage in talks with the Colombian government and then had to stay there after the negotiations collapsed. However, he may be currently based in Apure, Venezuela. ","Erlinto has been promoted to the ELN's top position as the ELN is on the ascendancy in both Colombia and Venezuela's criminal landscapes.Besides its traditional criminal economies such as kidnapping and extortion, the group now draws significant revenue from drug trafficking and illegal mining.What is uncertain is to what extent Erlinto will be able to influence the group's active criminal fronts from his exile in Havana and having been missing from the field for the last three years.","Erlinto was born in the city of Mocoa, in Colombia's northwest department of Putumayo. The ELN's strongholds are considered to be oil-rich areas of Colombia, such as the Eastern Plains and parts of the Andean mountain range. The ELN is also active on the other side of Colombia's border in Venezuela and Ecuador as well.","Stuck in Cuba, Garcia has been cut off from any personal alliances he may have had in Colombi. But the ELN's prominence in the criminal landscape of both Colombia and Venezuela has shifted dramatically since the FARC demobilized in 2016. The group has grown to arguably become the most significant criminal threat.As such, it has won crucial victories over criminal adversaries, including the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación - EPL) in Norte de Santander, Colombia and the Rastrojos at the Colombia-Venezuela border. More recently, the group has struggled to contain an alliance between the Rastrojos and the Urabeños, also known as Clan del Golfo (Gulf Clan), also at the Colombian border.   ","Garcia's proclamations in early 2015 showed he was an early supporter of peace talks with the Colombian government. After the FARC demobilized in 2016, following a peace agreement, the ELN began peace talks with the Colombian government in 2017, with these being moved to Cuba in 2018. However, these were suspended in January 2019 by the Colombian government, after the ELN set off a car bomb at a police training academy in Bogotá, killing 21 people. A prominent member of the ELN's negotiating team, Garcia was believed to be stuck in Cuba due to the risk of being arrested should he return to Colombia. However, there is credible information that he may be currently based in Apure, Venezuela. While it is uncertain how much power he has over ELN day-to-day operations, as these have expanded rapidly in Colombia and Venezuela, Garcia became the ranking leader of the ELN in June 2020 after the retirement of Nicolás Rodríguez Bautista, alias ""Gabino."" "
"José Adán Salazar Umaña, alias 'Chepe Diablo'",https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/jose-adan-salazar-chepe-diablo/,José Adán Salazar Umaña,Chepe Diablo,./images/individuals/josé-adán-salazar-umaña.jpg,2021-05-26,"['chepe diablo', 'el salvador personalities', 'texis cartel']",el,"José Adán Salazar Umaña, alias ""Chepe Diablo,"" does not fit the normal profile of a criminal leader. As the former president of the first division of Salvadoran soccer and the owner of numerous hotels, he is a prominent businessman and political operator. He has built a business empire around a chain of hotels, granaries and cattle ranches. Yet, officials from El Salvador and the United States say Salazar Umaña is one of the founders of the Texis Cartel, which controls El Salvador's Northern Route through which cocaine is brought from Honduras to Guatemala and money is laundered by the truckload.","Salazar Umaña enjoyed what at the time appeared to be a series legitimate business successes prior to being linked to drug trafficking. In 1990, he launched a small investment brokerage, shortly followed by five other firms including a hotel chain, transportation firm, livestock company and transportation business.Alongside local business figures Juan Umaña Samayoa and Roberto Herrera, Salazar is suspected of founding the Texis Cartel during this period. According to a report by El Faro, the group began running contraband through the mountainous northwest region that connects El Salvador with Honduras, prior to the early 1990s. Salvadoran authorities have been investigating the group since at least 2000. In 2001, the United States DEA mentioned Salazar Umaña as a suspected drug trafficker and money launderer. In 2014, the US Treasury Department put him on its ""Kingpin List"" of suspected money launderers. In April 2017, however, the Treasury Department reversed its decision and took him off the list, although the department has said it may bring other legal actions against him in the future.
Despite investigations into himself and the Texis Cartel, Salazar Umaña has managed to avoid criminal conviction. Critics have said this is not a sign of innocence but of strength. Salazar Umaña is allegedly supported by a large network of official protection, ranging from prosecutors and congressmen to police officers and judges, leading many cases against him to be shelved. Authorities have also said Salazar's business empire and veneer of legitimacy have given him added flexibility as a money launderer. The amount of legitimate cash flowing through Salazar Umaña's accounts make it easier to hide illicit revenues.In April 2014, Salazar Umaña was formally charged with tax evasion, amid attempts to topple Texis Cartel leadership by targeting financial operations. However, he was exonerated in January 2015, after paying some hefty fines. In 2016, the Attorney General's Office announced that it was actively investigating Salazar Umaña for money laundering, again. This investigation led to Salazar Umaña's April 2017 arrest in a police operation involving raids on about 50 of his properties, which authorities claim had been used by the Texis Cartel to evade taxes or launder money from illegal activities.In May 2021, charges of money laundering were dropped against Chepe Diablo with an El Salvador appeals court ruling he should not have been tried as he had already been judged for this alleged crime.",Salazar Umaña is suspected of crimes related to drug trafficking and money laundering. The Attorney General's Office believes he used dozens of companies to launder some $215 million.,Salazar Umaña's Texis Cartel operated in a northwestern slice of El Salvador running from the borders of Honduras and Guatemala.,"The Texis Cartel is noted for using bribery and corruption instead of the extreme violence often associated with Central American criminal groups. Salazar himself reportedly encourages members to rely on law enforcement for protection instead of carrying arms. Salazar Umaña reportedly has ties with and enjoys the support of numerous politicians, including Juan Umaña Samayoa, the mayor of Metapán, and Óscar Ortiz, the current vice president.","With high-placed political connections, including a former business partner who is the country's vice president, and a veneer of legitimacy, Salazar Umaña has generally avoided public scrutiny and dodged legal convictions. In May 2021, he again avoided prison when the money laundering charges against him were dropped on what appeared to be a legal technicality."
"Carlos Luis Revete, alias 'El Koki'",https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/carlos-luis-revete-alias-el-koki/,Carlos Luis Revete,El Koki,./images/individuals/carlos-luis-revete.jpg,2022-02-08,"['el koki', 'venezuela personalities']",venezuela,"Carlos Luis Revete, alias ""El Koki"" o ""Coqui"",was one of Venezuela’s most wanted criminals and leader of the “megabanda"" that controls the Cota 905 and La Vega districts in western Caracas.Despite facing charges for crimes including robbery, murder and drug trafficking since 2013, Revette enjoyed remarkable levels of impunity. The non-aggression pact he reached with Venezuelan authorities epitomized the near-total abdication of the state in the marginalized urban districts controlled by the megabandas.In 2021, the relationship between Revette and the Venezuelan authorities became steadily more hostile. After his takeover of La Vega in early 2021, there has been a rise in large-scale operations by government forces against El Koki's gang. While these have led to many arrests in Cota 905 and La Vega, it is unclear if they made any real difference in weakening El Koki. He fled Cota 905 in mid-2021 and remained on the run until February 2022 when he was reportedly shot and killed by security forces in Venezuela's state of Aragua.","Revette was born in 1978 and grew up in the poor districts of Caracas. Little was known of his life until 2013, when he was charged with the murder of Greiber Danilo Alonso Lucas in the “Los Alpes” sector of Cota 905. At the time, Revette is believed to have been a member of a street gang known as “Los Chiches,” and killed Alonso in response to a photo on social media of Alonso posing with an enemy of the gang.Cota 905 is one of Caracas’ most violent neighborhoods, home to a plethora of urban gangs. The district has been subjected to years of arbitrary and violent policing, creating a profound antipathy towards the security services among its residents. In this context, the gangs gained social power as de facto rule enforcers of the community.Revette rose to prominence as lieutenant of gang leader, Jesús Alberto Ramos Calderón, alias “El Chavo,” who set out in 2014 to unite the Caracas gangs against the police. The initiative contributed to the emergence of a new criminal structure in Venezuela: “megabandas” comprising over 50 members, more organized and heavily armed than traditional street gangs and modeled on the hierarchical structure of Venezuelan prison gangs. After Ramos was killed by the criminal investigation unit (CICPC) in January 2015, Revette assumed leadership of his new megabanda in Cota 905. Revette continued Ramos’ unification project and is credited by some sources with having united the gangs of Cota 905, El Cementerio and El Valle.In January 2015, Cota 905 was placed under the Maduro government’s “Peace Zone” policy, in which authorities ceded territorial control to criminal organizations in exchange for a reduction of violence. This truce was broken in July of the same year with the introduction of Maduro’s “Operation Liberation of the People” (Operación Liberación del Pueblo – OLP), a heavy-handed security crackdown that heralded a return to the brutal policing and human rights abuses of the past. The first OLP raid in Cota 905 resulted in the deaths of 15 people, of whom only six had criminal records. Revette was not among them, having taken shelter in a prison just hours before the raid. He continued to evade capture throughout the operation, stoking suspicions that its true targets were Revette’s rivals.In August 2017, current vice-president and then president of the National Constituent Assembly, Delcy Rodríguez, visited Cota 905. Residents are said to have petitioned the officials to restore the Peace Zone policy and prohibit the entry of police into the neighborhood. However, InSight Crime sources revealed that the delegation also met with Revette during the visit, and are believed to have reached a pact with the criminal leader. The Peace Zone policy was reactivated in the district and security forces withdrew.The state’s abandonment of Cota 905 converted the district into a criminal enclave where the mega-gangs held free reign. Although the “pax mafiosa” between gangs and security forces may have reduced violence, it also allowed gangs such as Revette’s to amass heavy weaponry and consolidate their criminal economies. By 2016, Revette’s gang was estimated at between 70 and 120 members, using Cota 905 as a base of operations for extortion, kidnapping and vehicle theft. However, when including allied gangs, he may be able to call on as many as 180 men.Within the Peace Zone of Cota 905, Revette enjoys near-total impunity, strikingly demonstrated by a video of him partying openly in the neighborhood, circulated on social media. More alarmingly, the policy seems to be enabling the megabandas to achieve ever greater levels of integration and organization. As of mid-2019, Revette was working with fellow gang leader Carlos Alfredo Calderón Martínez, alias “El Vampi,” to command a mega-gang of around 180 members with a criminal empire extending beyond Caracas.2019 showed how safe El Koki felt he was. In June 2019, El Koki took part in the lavish funeral of one of his gang members, at which Alex de Castro, a known Puerto Rican salsa dancer and pastor led the ceremony.In July, members of El Koki's gang attacked CICPC officials in Cota 905. Shortly after CICPC officers were ordered to leave the area, a situation which has become common when El Koki's gang is involved. The police is essentially forbidden from entering areas controlled by the gang.In late December 2020 and early January 2021, members of El Koki's gang reportedly invaded La Vega, a popular neighborhood in Caracas which, although close to Cota 905, had never been occupied by the gang. On January 6, security forces, largely from the FAES, entered the neighborhood seemingly to chase out the gang. The operation lasted until January 9 and reportedly left 23 dead. Human rights defenders called it the largest-scale police killings in the country's history. And while many of the victims have not been formerly identified, InSight Crime was able to confirm that El Koki was not among the dead.Since then, La Vega has become El Koki's second major base of operations, in part thanks to an alliance with a smaller gang, run by Yorfren Javier Guédez Bullones, alias “El Mayeya.""  In July 2021, Revette carried out his most daring act of defiance so far. Members of his gang opened fire on El Helicoide, a vast building in central Caracas that acts as a headquarters for police and intelligence services and contains numerous jail cells, as well as two other police facilities. The response was swift. Government forces entered Cota 905 in a major raid that lasted five days, seemingly to capture El Koki and his top lieutenants. They took over observation posts that El Koki’s gang had built overlooking the neighborhood, burned down a known nightclub where the gang gathered and reportedly seized the house of El Vampi, Revette’s closest lieutenant.El Koki remained on the run for months, with rumors circling about his presence in Venezuela, Colombia or even Peru. However, on February 6, 2022, news surfaced that he had been wounded in a shootout in the town of Tejerías, in Venezuela's state of Aragua. Two days later, he was dead, allegedly shot by members of Venezuela's criminal investigation unit (Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas – CICPC).","Revette was wanted on numerous charges including robbery, murder and drug trafficking. His gang controls criminal activity throughout the Cota 905 district, primarily drug-dealing and vehicle theft, although they are also involved in kidnapping and extortion schemes.The gang was known to brutally murder criminal challengers, as seen in the massacre of seven members of a rival gang in February 2019.Police sources consulted by InSight Crime, said on condition of anonymity, that Revette also frequently used other ""Peace Zones"" in Los Valles del Tuy, in the state of Miranda, to find refuge.","Revette’s territory of Cota 905 is a populous hillside district in the southwest of Caracas. It was part of a gang stronghold that includes the sectors of El Cementario and El Valle. Revette’s alliances with other local gangs meant that he exercised effective control over much of this area. His two closest lieutenants were Carlos Alfredo Calderón Martínez, alias “El Vampi,” and Garbis Ochoa Ruiz, alias “El Garbis,” giving this criminal federation control of a territory of roughly 20 square kilometers in the southwest of Caracas.In 2021, he extended his area of control to La Vega, a neighborhood of 120,000 residents in western Caracas.","Despite being one of Venezuela’s most wanted criminals, Revette appeared to have reached an understanding with the Maduro administration that allowed him to operate with near-total impunity. Furthermore, he had shown himself willing to violently defend this pact when necessary. In February 2019, his gang killed seven members of a smaller gang led by Elvis Eduardo Castro Troya, alias “El Culón.” It is believed that the massacre was in retaliation for the killing of two soldiers by Castro Troya’s gang, which breached the terms of the “pax mafiosa” between the gangs of west Caracas and the Venezuelan state.Revette was also willing to work together with other gang leaders to expand his criminal empire. 2019 intelligence reports suggested he reached an alliance with Carlos Alfredo Calderón Martínez, alias “El Vampi,” and Garbis Ochoa Ruiz, alias “El Garbis,” to form a still larger gang.In 2021, his invasion of La Vega saw him ally with another gang, run by Yorfren Javier Guédez Bullones, alias “El Mayeya.""","Revette’s record of evading capture while expanding his gang’s criminal activities demonstrated his ability to exploit the Maduro administration’s contradictory policing initiatives for his own purposes. He showed himself to be highly skilled in reaching agreements with both authorities and rival gangs in order to consolidate territorial control and guarantee his impunity. From 2017, the withdrawal of police from Cota 905 allowed Revette to build a high-caliber arsenal estimated at 200 grenades, 15 AR-15 rifles and 150 smaller firearms. With this, his gang rivals the firepower of security forces.El Koki was also protected due to having widespread sympathy and loyalty among residents of Cota 905, who saw him as a benefactor.However, his invasion of La Vega and subsequent attack on police installations over the course of 2021 appear to have ended his impunity. Security forces invaded Cota 905 and drove him out, forcing him to flee. He remained on the run for months, until being shot dead in Venezuela's state of Aragua in February 2022."

With between 150 and 200 people in its ranks, the Wilexis gang controls the José Félix Ribas neighborhood, the largest of the violent Petare slums in eastern Caracas.He is wanted by the authorities for extortion, kidnapping, theft and micro-trafficking. Additionally, Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro has accused him of working with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) for Operation Gedeón, although there is no known evidence supporting this accusation.","Wilexis’s criminal career began around 2003 but really began to grow from 2013, when he formed a small gang dedicated to kidnappings, robberies and hired killings. His gang operated in Petare along with a number of other criminal groups. However, a number of his rivals were gradually eliminated by police operations and by 2017, the Wilexis gang started to position itself as the strongest gang in José Félix Ribas.InSight Crime interviewed a number of residents of José Félix Ribas who said the rise of Wilexis was partially enabled by the local mayor, José Vicente Rangel Ávalos, who was elected in 2017. InSight Crime was not able to independently verify claims of such a relationship.Beyond the role of the mayor, other factors allowed the Wilexis gang to assume control of José Felix Ribas, including a lack of police presence. In 2013, when Rangel Ávalos was deputy security minister, he reportedly declared the neighborhood a “Peace Zone” under a government program where security forces would stay out of certain areas as long as local gangs maintained the peace.The gang’s growing power led to Wilexis usurping state functions, acting as a judge ruling on neighborhood problems, taking a role in local politics and even organizing public events. Residents reported that, in the eyes of many, Wilexis is seen as a “Robin Hood” that brings gifts to children and families in need, delivering government-subsidized food boxes. The group is also responsible for local security, stopping theft and minor crimes against residents, and punishing those who commit these crimes. Although there are no official figures, violence has likely declined overall in the José Félix Ribas neighborhood under Wilexis’ rule.In fact, the local community has protested alleged extrajudicial killings, as well as other abuses of police power, committed by the National Bolivarian Police’s Special Action Forces unit (Fuerzas de Acciones Especiales - FAES) on three occasions in recent years. Arguing that the Wilexis gang has protected them, they urged the authorities to officially designate the neighborhood as a peace zone. However, sources say that the gang has forced residents to hold these protests.In January 2019, when the president of the National Assembly proclaimed himself interim president, residents of the José Félix Ribas neighborhood held a protest in his favor, an action allowed by the criminal boss. Violence against protesters led to clashes with the Maduro regime and made Wilexis a wanted man.Between April and May 2020, Wilexis saw the group’s territorial control disputed by a criminal named Christian Rene Tovar Uribe, alias “El Gusano,” who was rumored to have been sent from the Tocorón prison in order to take back control of the neighborhood where he allegedly used to operate. The armed encounters between the two gangs lasted for close to two weeks.On May 6, amidst the hostilities, President Nicolás Maduro accused Wilexis, without any evidence to support his claims, of having faked the armed confrontations in order to distract from Operation Gedeón, which occurred during this time in collaboration with the DEA and the alleged financing of a drug trafficker named Richard Cammarano. In the same public statement, Maduro called upon his ministers to arrest Wilexis.Following Maduro’s speech, the media outlet NTN24 received an audio recording of a man who identified himself as Wilexis, denying the president’s accusations and alleging that he did not have contact with the DEA, nor any interest in Maduro’s departure from power. Two days later, the FAES conducted an operation in the José Félix Ribas neighborhood in search of Wilexis, but it ended in the extrajudicial deaths of 13 people.On May 14, a commission of the Scientific, Criminal and Criminalistic Investigations Corps (Cuerpo de Investigaciones de Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas - Cicpc) killed El Gusano in a confrontation, putting an end to the dispute with Wilexis. While they killed members of the gang in various operations in the suburbs of Caracas, the criminal boss was not found, presumed to be hiding from the authorities.Wilexis returned to José Félix Ribas in July, where he remained, keeping a low profile, for five months until he was discovered during a FAES operation in November. While he was reportedly injured, he managed to escape once again. Four members of the gang were killed in the incident.After overcoming the operations seeking to bring him down in May 2020 and after being wounded in a shootout with security forces in November 2020, Wilexis kept a low profile for almost a year. After this, however, he returned to being a thorn in the side of authorities.According to a FAES official interviewed by InSight Crime, who asked for anonymity for security reasons, Wilexis’ gang has come roaring back in Caracas since October 2021. While his center of power was always the neighborhood of José Félix Ribas, he has expanded his control to the neighborhoods of San José de Petare, La Dolorita and 5 de Julio, as well as the Petare-Guarenas highway, east of Caracas.A senior official of the FAES also told InSight Crime that, after operations in Caracas’ district of Cota 905 sought to break the power of Carlos Luis Revete, alias “El Koki,” a number of his gang members fled to Petare. Wilexis has apparently learned from what happened to the other gang boss and has taken steps to prevent such a raid coming after him. Furthermore, the FAES official stated that the sheer size of Petare, the largest slum in Venezuela, makes it far more difficult to infiltrate.In October 21, Wilexis’ expanson saw his gang members clash with increased frequency with rival gangs, leaving a number of civilians dead.","The Wilexis gang is involved in kidnapping and extortion schemes, in addition to controlling micro-trafficking in areas under its control. The extortions are demanded of informal merchants in the area, who are required to pay a “vacuna”, as extortion payments are referred to in Venezuela, for providing security.The kidnapping victims are frequently located in Caracas or neighboring areas and held hostage in the homes of criminals within the neighborhood. While the extortion demands may be equivalent to around $30 per month, the kidnapping ransom fees, while less frequent, can be up to $20,000, according to interviews with local residents.","Petare is a strategic territory for the gang, densely populated and with a complex labyrinth of staircases and alleyways that facilitate criminals’ escapes to other areas during police operations. The mega-gang is present in approximately 20 different zones within Petare. The group’s greatest area of influence is observed within the José Félix Ribas neighborhood, particularly between zones 6 and 10. It also has a presence in surrounding neighborhoods, such as Maca, Barrio Unión, La Bombilla, Simón Bolívar, and 24 de Marzo. In 2021, the gang expanded into the neighborhoods of San José de Petare, La Dolorita and 5 de Julio, as well as along the Petare-Guarenas highway, east of Caracas.Members of the Wilexis gang have also sought refuge in the suburbs of Caracas, like Los Teques and Guatire, where police have found gang members.","Now that Wilexis is one of the recent players in Caracas’ criminal panorama, in comparison to other gangs that have controlled territories for longer, the gang has few known alliances.It is presumed that there is a kind of Pax Mafiosa with José Vicente Rangel Ávalos, the pro-government mayor of the Sucre municipality, who, as the director of the municipal police, has not carried out operations against the criminal.Despite attempts by community leaders to mediate with the mayor during the May confrontation in favor of the gang, it is unclear whether the alliance continues after government statements and recent operations.","Despite the official narrative against Wilexis, the fact that he remains free may be evidence of the government’s general indifference toward a gang that maintains control over a significant part of the country’s largest and most violent slum, which could be of benefit to the Maduro government.The battle against El Gusano likely served to cow Wilexis, as a response to his apparent support of the opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, during the January 23 protests, when he allowed the community to hold a protest against the Maduro regime and even confronted the security forces who threatened protesters.And Wilexis and his gang remain under the eye of the FAES, the only security unit to regularly pursue members of the Wilexis gang, albeit without sustained success. much success. The last clash between the FAES and the Wilexis gang, which occurred in November, reaffirmed the will of the group in question to take down the gang.Wilexis’ eventual arrest or death could result in a power vacuum in Petare that would likely fuel a dispute between small gangs in the area over control of the territory and bring violence back to the neighborhood, a scenario that the Maduro government and the municipal administration of Rangel Ávalos probably want to avoid. Therefore, they might prefer to tolerate the leader and allow him to continue operating like so many other groups in Caracas."
"Ricardo Abel Ayala Orrego, alias 'Cabuyo'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/ricardo-abel-ayala-ortega-alias-cabuyo/,Ricardo Abel Ayala Orrego,Cabuyo,./images/individuals/ricardo-abel-ayala-orrego.jpg,2021-04-23,"['colombia personalities', 'ex-farc mafia']",colombia,"Ricardo Abel Ayala Orrego, alias ""Cabuyo,"" was the leader of the ex-FARC Mafia's 36th Front in the northwestern department of Antioquia.Ayala Orrego gained relevance after the implementation of the peace process between the government and the now-defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). He was part of the FARC’s Iván Ríos Bloc but he refused to demobilize, preferring instead to lead the 36th Front of the ex-FARC Mafia, dedicated to drug trafficking and illegal gold mining.About 50 armed men allegedly reported to Ayala Orrego in the municipalities of Ituango, Valdivia, Campamento and Tarazá in the north of Antioquia. This region has a high number of coca plantations and illegal mines, as well as being a nerve center for drug routes out of Colombia through the Urabá Gulf and the Colombian Pacific. He was killed in an army operation in Barbosa, Antioquia in June 2022. ","Cabuyo joined the FARC’s 36th Front in 2010, becoming a member of what was considered to be the most active front within the Iván Ríos Bloc.He reportedly began as an active militiaman in the municipality of Campamento, Antioquia. before becoming a foot soldier within the 36th Front's Gerardo Torres company in 2011, providing security around coca crops and illegal mines. In 2015, he took on more responsibilities within the 36th Front, such as managing drug trafficking money, conducting select contract killings and recruiting new members. During the peace negotiations between the FARC and the government of Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos, Ayala Orrego initially took part in the demobilization efforts. He handed over his weapons in the village of La Plancha in Anorí, Antioquia before being appointed by the FARC to take part in demining efforts in the village of Orejón de Briceño, Antioquia. However, he appears to have quickly abandoned the peace process and returned to his criminal ways. Ayala Orrego's name next appeared in January 2018, when he reportedly extorted businesses associated with the Hidroituango hydroelectric project located along the Cauca River, especially in the municipalities of Briceño and Ituango.He was also allegedly involved in the murders of three geologists from the Canadian multinational Continental Gold in the village of Ochalí, in the municipality of Yarumal Antioquia, on September 19, 2018. After this incident, the Colombian military increased its offensives against the ex-FARC Mafia's 36th Front. Until his death, Cabuyo was one of the most sought after criminals in Colombia, with authorities offering 200 million pesos ($9 million) for information leading to his capture.","Ayala Orrego was recognized as the principal military leader of the ex–FARC Mafia in northern Antioquia and Bajo Cauca.Under the command of Cabuyo, the 36th Front fought the Urabeños over territorial control and criminal economies in the region since the end of 2017, resulting in an increase in homicides and forced displacements in the region. In 2019, Yamir Arles Moreno, a key witness in legal proceedings brought against Cabuyo by the Attorney General's Office, was kidnapped and is believed to be dead.Additionally, Cabuyo controlled much of the illegal gold mining in northern Antioquia, a department in which 80 percent of the gold is extracted illegally, according to Colombia's Comptroller's Office.In April 2021, media reports circulated that Cabuyo had been killed in February of that year in a clash with the country's armed forces, but he was later found to have only been injured. He was, however, finally killed in June 2022.","Cabuyo began to expand his influence over the municipalities of Ituango, Valdivia and Briceño in northern Antioquia by extorting a number of multinational energy companies. Similarly, he maintained a presence in the Paramillo Massif, disputing the routes that facilitate drug trafficking from Bajo Cauca in Antioquia to the Gulf of Urabá.Cabuyo was spotted no several occasions in northeastern Antioquia, seemingly looking to find new recruits around the municipality of Anorí, likely because his front was being weakened by continued military operations and the arrests of some of his collaborators.","Cabuyo maintained his position in Antioquia’s criminal landscape through a careful network of alliances. His most important alliances were with Los Caparrapos and the ELN, which shared his objective of expelling the Urabeños from Bajo Cauca and the Paramillo Massif; a strategic point for the production and transport of coca paste.Meanwhile, the 36th Front also maintains a close alliance with the 18th Front of the ex-FARC Mafia, a structure led by Erlison Echavarría, alias “Ramiro."" It also has ties with ex–FARC Mafia structures led by Iván Márquez, although this does not seem to have materialized into direct military support. Cabuyo’s relationships within the criminal underworld are not limited to the north of Antioquia in terms of alliances. In the Aburrá Valley, which includes the city of Medellín, the 36th Front has exchanged weapons for drugs with groups including the Pachelly, El Mesa and El Tapón.Cabuyo’s main enemies in the criminal underworld were the Urabeños, although he was also targeted by 7th Division of Colombia's national army, which has led repeated military operations against the 36th Front.","Cabuyo’s military capacity in the northern part of Antioquia was reduced by operations by military forces and the conflict in Bajo Cauca and the northern part of the department. Now, following his death, the 36th Front will likely face new attempts by the Urabeños to erase them from the criminal map in northern Antioquia, while army operations will undoubtedly continue to target what is left of the front.With his death, the 18th Front lost a key ally in its efforts to keep the Urabeños out of its territory, and its leader, alias “Ramiro,” is likely to become the armed forces' new high-value target in the area."
Chapitos,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/los-chapitos/,Chapitos,,./images/individuals/chapitos.jpg,2022-01-09,"['el chapo', 'mexico', 'mexico groups', 'mexico personalities', 'sinaloa cartel', 'us/mexico border']",us/mexico,"The now-jailed former Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo,” reportedly had many children but only a select few of them, known collectively as the Chapitos, are at the center of an ongoing internal feud for control of the group’s operations against the last remaining member of the so-called “old guard,” Ismael Zambada García, alias “El Mayo.”While neither side has yet to exert the type of dominance that would make clear who is really in charge of the group’s criminal activities, there’s been no shortage of blood spilled as the two internal factions battle it out.In 2021 and 2022, the Chapitos continued to gain in strength becoming among the main producers and traffickers of fentanyl and methamphetamine to the United States. They expanded their territorial control in Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Sonora, and Baja California, and reinforced their earnings by profiting from illegal mining, fishing, migrant smuggling and more. They were named InSight Crime's Criminal Winners for 2022.They suffered a blow, however, when Ovidio Guzmán López was arrested for the second time in Sinaloa on January 5, 2023, leading to a major outbreak of violence in which more than two dozen people were killed. ","While El Chapo is said to have dozens of children, four of them have figured prominently into the Sinaloa Cartel’s criminal operations: Joaquín Guzmán López, Ovidio Guzmán López, Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar.Ovidio, Iván, and Jesús Alfredo were apparently brought into the Sinaloa Cartel’s criminal operations at a young age as teenagers by their father and El Mayo in order to learn the ins and outs of the organization. Ovidio, who was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2012 and indicted in February 2019, has garnered the most attention in recent years.In October 2019, Mexican security forces launched a poorly planned operation to capture Ovidio in the Sinaloa state capital of Culiacán. Shortly after word of Ovidio’s detention spread, Sinaloa Cartel members responded in force, swarming the city and launching an all-out offensive to demand his release. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ultimately “ordered that the operation be stopped and that the presumed criminal be set free.”According to the US Treasury Department, Ovidio is said to be a “key lieutenant” within the Sinaloa Cartel’s ranks.For their part, Iván and Jésus are also thought to be important cartel operatives. In 2016, the two brothers were among a group of men abducted by the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación - CJNG) from a restaurant in an upscale district of the Mexican tourism center, Puerto Vallarta, in Jalisco state, the CJNG’s home turf. Both sons were later released.However, Jésus seems to have taken on an increasingly prominent role in the Sinaloa Cartel’s business. In fact, he has landed himself on the US Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) most wanted list, the only son to earn that distinction. In 2015, US prosecutors also indicted him alongside his father and a number of other cartel leaders on drug trafficking charges. Jésus is also believed to play an important international role for the group. In 2016, he allegedly spent a few months in the Colombian city of Medellín under the protection of La Terraza, one of the sprawling city’s most powerful criminal gangs. Not much is known about Joaquín, who has kept a relatively low profile in comparison to his other brothers. That said, in February 2019, the US Justice Department indicted him alongside Ovidio for conspiring to traffic cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States. The indictment itself lacked detailed specifics but US prosecutors allege the trafficking took place over the course of a decade between April 2008 and April 2018 for the Sinaloa Cartel.In their father’s absence following his final 2016 arrest and subsequent extradition, the Chapitos have been at odds with El Mayo, as well as their uncle, Aureliano Guzmán Loera, alias “El Guano,” over control of the group’s operations.Given that their father founded the group, the sons seem to have felt entitled to inherit what their father created. While indeed much flashier with spending drug proceeds and partying than El Mayo, the Chapitos do know the inner workings of the cartel and are looking to assume supreme control.As a result, fierce battles between the two sides have continued for years. Most recently, in May 2020, José Rodrigo Aréchiga Gamboa, alias “El Chino Antrax” -- once the head of the Sinaloa Cartel’s Antrax hit squad and an associate of El Mayo -- was found dead after escaping federal probation supervision in San Diego. The Chapitos are believed to be behind the slaying.El Chino Antrax was a close associate of El Mayo, growing up with the Zambada family and alongside El Mayo’s sons in Culiacán. This long history makes it unlikely that the aging capo would have had much to gain from killing a long-time ally at a time when he could have needed him as internal tensions remain high.In June 2020, a multi-hour shootout reportedly between the two sides outside Culiacán left 16 dead.While the Chapitos have kept the heat up, US authorities have taken note. At the end of 2021, the US State Department announced that, in addition to facing federal drug trafficking charges, the government had upped its reward to $20 million for information that would help them in capturing the four sons. The US Treasury Department has also sanctioned the Chapitos under the so-called Kingpin Act.Despite being in the crosshairs of US authorities, the Chapitos have only stepped up their efforts to exert dominance over the group their father once led. In February 2022, armed men - reportedly loyal to the Chapitos - riding in a convoy of dozens of vehicles laid siege on the municipality of Caborca near the US-Mexico border. For hours, the convoy occupied the city as local police were unable to repel them until morning. In the end, the attack left two dead and at least five others kidnapped.With the help of the Salazar, a local group aligned with the Sinaloa Cartel for years, the Chapitos have sought to secure control of a key drug trafficking corridor stretching from their home base in Sinaloa, through Sonora and Baja California, and over the US-Mexico border.Increased firepower may be helping their bid. In early March, the Mexican Army and National Guard raided four houses in Navojoa municipality in the south of Sonora state, seizing an arsenal of almost three million rounds of ammunition of varying calibers, six .50 caliber rifles, more than 150 handguns and automatic rifles, dozens of grenades and 12 bulletproof vests, among other drugs, magazines and tactical gear. This was one of the largest criminal arsenals ever seized in Mexico.After their notoriety rose significantly through 2021 and 2022, the Chapitos suffered a blow on January 5, 2023, when Ovidio was arrested in Culiacan, the state capital of Sinaloa. According to Mexican Defense Minister Luis Crescencio Sandoval, an Army patrol came upon a convoy of six armored trucks. The occupants refused to cooperate with a check of the vehicles and opened fire on security forces. A large number of alleged Sinaloa Cartel members were arrested after the shootout, including Ovidio. At least seven soldiers were killed in this initial exchange of fire.Following his arrest, much like in 2019, blockades were set up across the city and other parts of Sinaloa, with cartel gunmen taking shots at police and army troops and even bringing down a military helicopter. Within hours, President López Obrador sent in reinforcements to calm the situation. As of January 9, at least 29 people had been killed following Ovidio's arrest, including ten Mexican soldiers.While Ovidio was not released this time, this action proved the rapid mobilization and response capacity of the Sinaloa Cartel on their own turf.","The Chapitos’ main business, much like their father before them, is international drug trafficking. According to various US indictments, the sons are involved in trafficking large quantities of everything from cocaine and marijuana to methamphetamine into the United States using their vast web of contacts throughout Latin America.In particular, the group has adjusted to shifting drug markets and become ever more involved in the synthetic drug trade alongside the CJNG, especially with regards to trafficking the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. In fact, the Chapitos have expanded their activities to include the exploitation of drug rehab centers to recruit new traffickers – yet another source of continued violence with El Mayo.In addition, the group has also looked beyond the US market and started tapping into lucrative markets in Australia.Today, the Chapitos are among the main suppliers of fentanyl and methamphetamine into the United States. The US Justice Department issued charges against them for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana in 2021 and rewards of $5 million have been announced for each of them.","The primary stomping grounds for the Chapitos are in their birthplace of Sinaloa state, the group's fiefdom in northwest Mexico along the country’s Pacific coast, especially in the capital city of Culiacán. However, El Chapo’s sons seem to have much more sway and strength within Culiacán and other urban centers. On the other hand, El Mayo is believed to maintain a strong hold on his rural networks in the areas surrounding the capital city, which the Chapitos haven’t yet been able to seize control of.As a whole, the Sinaloa Cartel is operational in major cities stretching from New York City to Buenos Aires and countless others in between. The group also operates in at least 17 Mexican states, and by some estimates, in as many as 50 countries.More recently, the feud between the Chapitos and El Mayo has spread beyond its longtime center in Sinaloa to reach the states of Baja California and Sonora.And in September 2021, reports surfaced that representatives of the Chapitos were regularly travelling to Mexico City to seek to extend their influence there. In early 2021, Mexican authorities took down the Sinaloas, a cell of the Sinaloa Cartel reportedly under the influence of the Chapitos operating in the nearby State of Mexico. But this has not stopped the Chapitos from continuing to expand into the capital, especially in the microtrafficking scene of Tepito and Tlalpan.In 2022, they also intensified a long-running battle against the Caborca Cartel in Sonora, following the arrest of that rival group's founder, Rafael Caro Quintero.","At the present moment, their father’s former right-hand man, El Mayo, appears to be internal enemy number one for the Chapitos. In addition, there have been reported family frictions with their uncle, El Guano, over control of drug trafficking territory and alleged extortion payments he was thought to be charging in parts of Sinaloa.In addition, the Chapitos have battled the Beltrán Leyva Organization, the Sinaloa Cartel’s one-time ally before a 2008 split kicked off a bloody battle between the two groups. In 2016, more than 100 Beltrán Leyva members were reportedly responsible for looting El Chapo’s mother’s home in the mountains of Sinaloa, forcing her and hundreds of others from nearby communities to flee the area.To help in their ongoing turf wars, the Chapitos have recruited allies across several states. This list includes former rivals such as Pablo Edwin Huerta Nuno, alias “El Flaquito,” formerly of the Arellano Felix Cartel in Baja California, as well as longtime associates such as Néstor Ernesto Pérez Salas, alias “has also sanctioned,” in Culiacán.Some experts have also suggested that the CJNG has benefited from the ongoing feud between Los Chapitos and El Mayo, in turn strengthened their power and control over parts of Mexico.But the CJNG remain a top enemy of the Chapitos as they and the Sinaloa Cartel battle for ultimate control over Mexico’s vast criminal economies. CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias “El Mencho,” even allegedly assembled a hit squad to hunt down and kill El Chapo’s sons.
","Looking ahead, the Chapitos certainly have a leg up on El Mayo as far as longevity goes. The old capo is reportedly in bad health and battling diabetes. However, El Mayo’s roots in the Sinaloa Cartel run deep. The fact that the Chapitos have been unsuccessful in seizing total control of the group’s operations thus far suggests that El Mayo still has plenty of fight left in him.However, their grip is slowly tightening. The expansion of their territory to Sonora, Baja California and Chihuahua has given them a major advantage along the US border. Their specialization in synthetic drug trafficking, alongside marijuana and cocaine, provides an ever-steady supply of cash. And their reputation, through the Chapiza movement, continues to grow.The arrest of Ovidio in January 2023, however, poses a major question. Will the group stay united, or will fractures begin to emerge?"
Juan Antonio 'Tony' Hernández Alvarado,https://insightcrime.org/honduras-organized-crime-news/tony-hernandez/,Juan Antonio 'Tony' Hernández Alvarado,,./images/individuals/juan-antonio-'tony'-hernández-alvarado.jpg,2020-09-03,"['honduras', 'honduras personalities', 'juan orlando hernández', 'tony hernández']",honduras,"Juan Antonio “Tony” Hernández Alvarado is a former Honduran congressman, the brother of former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernández and a convicted drug trafficker sentenced in the United States for his participation in moving cocaine.From Honduras, Tony directed a sophisticated international drug trafficking ring that reconfigured the drug trafficking map with Central America as the main focal point, relying on political protection from the highest levels of government to succeed.","The Hernández Alvarado family is originally from the city of Gracias, the capital of western Lempira department. From there, Tony Hernández and his brother Juan Orlando began their political careers with the National Party (Partido Nacional -- PN).Tony trained as a lawyer and was chosen as an alternate representative in 2013. He replaced congressman Samuel Reyes in 2014 and remained in Honduras’ Congress until 2018.According to his indictment in the United States, Tony helped to traffic ""multi-ton loads"" of cocaine between 2004 and 2016. His proximity to the highest levels of Honduran political power and the country’s main drug trafficking groups made him one of the most influential organized crime operators of the last decade in Honduras.Tony’s role was not as a kingpin but as a mediator between various criminal actors and those in power. According to documents from his trial in the United States, Tony offered protection to drug traffickers and facilitated their operations in exchange for their support of the National Party’s political campaigns, including those of his brother.According to the testimony of a former Honduran army official who worked in anti-narcotics, Tony began his criminal career with the Valle Valle brothers. Based in the department of Copán on the border with Guatemala, they ran one of the most important drug trafficking operations over the last decade in Honduras.Tony allegedly helped the Valle Valle brothers to consolidate their control of the drug route that traverses Honduras’ west, including the department of Lempira. Later on, in his role as a lawyer, Tony did favors for the Valle Valle brothers’ legitimate businesses.Alexander “Chande” Ardón, the former mayor of the municipality of El Paraíso currently detained in the United States, also operated in Copán. Ardón headed a drug trafficking group known as the AA Cartel which often found itself in dispute with the Valle Valle brothers. According to judicial documents, including Ardón’s testimony, Tony helped Ardón form a “mafia peace” in Copán with the Valle Valle brothers.In 2009, Tony had also offered to protect Ardón’s drug trafficking operations in exchange for a $2 million contribution to his brother Juan Orlando’s congressional campaign and to Porfirio Lobo’s presidential campaign.According to the US Justice Department, Tony helped Ardón move many kilograms of drugs via helicopters and vehicles between 2010 and 2012. He also helped the former mayor get rid of his rivals.Other testimonies against Tony Hernández include that of Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga, the Cachiros boss extradited to the United States. In his testimony to US authorities in 2017, Rivera Maradiaga admitted to meeting with Tony Hernández in 2014 to discuss debts between his brother’s government and a Cachiros-owned construction company that had been awarded various contracts under the previous administration. Furthermore, he confirmed that he gave the former congressman $50,000 as a bribe.Víctor Hugo Díaz Morales, alias “El Rojo” -- a Honduran drug trafficker arrested in Guatemala and extradited to the United States -- also testified against Tony in 2019 and said that he had given $100,000 in 2009 in support of the congressional campaigns of the former president Porfirio Lobo and Tony’s brother Juan Orlando. Tony also charged El Rojo $55,000 for information related to the transfer of drug shipments.In Honduras, Tony Hernández has still yet to face any legal proceedings. However, beginning in October of 2016, authorities in the United States listed the then-congressman as a “person of interest” in an investigation against Wilter Blanco, the former leader of the Atlantic Cartel.Hernández was arrested on November 23, 2018 at the Miami airport on drug trafficking and arms trafficking charges.In addition to the testimonies of extradited drug traffickers, US authorities also presented as evidence the “narcolibretas,” or drug ledgers, of a trafficker Hernández worked with -- who was later brutally murdered in jail -- in which records of drug shipments going to and from Honduras and bribe payments were kept. Authorities also asserted that Hernández had received money from the Mexican drug trafficker Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo.”All of this contributed to a guilty verdict reached in October 2019. At the moment, he is awaiting sentencing in the United States. Hernández’s lawyers have managed to delay the sentencing several times, though it is currently set for September 16, 2020.Tony Hernández’s punishment could range from a minimum sentence of 30 years to a maximum sentence of life in prison.","In the United States, Tony Hernández was found guilty of participating in the international trafficking of cocaine. Judicial documents indicate that he was involved in the processing, reception, transportation and distribution of cocaine shipments that arrived in Honduras by air and sea. Tony allegedly stamped these shipments with his initials, TH.A laboratory in the Honduran department of Cortés, supposedly protected by Tony and his brother Juan Orlando, had a production capacity of between 300 and 500 kilograms of cocaine per month, according to US authorities.US authorities have also accused him of trafficking arms, delivering bribes to local politicians and, on at least two occasions, arranging the assassinations of rival drug traffickers.","Tony Hernández is originally from the department of Lempira, in western Honduras. Authorities found a drug laboratory there in 2014 that allegedly belonged to the former congressman.Tony’s criminal influence expanded to other departments, especially those in Honduras’ west on the border with Guatemala. His closest criminal allies -- the Valle Valle brothers and Alexander Ardón -- operated in the border departments of Santa Bárbara, Ocotepeque and Copán, the latter serving as the primary center of operations.The drug route that traverses these departments is the most important in the country, serving as the transit route for the majority of cocaine arriving from Venezuela and Colombia. Since 2015, between 150 and 300 tons of cocaine have passed through this route annually, according to InSight Crime estimates. The route continues on to the Guatemalan department of Petén, where the drugs are then trafficked to Mexico.According to US judicial documents, Tony Hernández also had access to a cocaine laboratory in Colombia and worked with associates in Guatemala and Mexico.","Tony Hernández was the link between his brother’s government and Honduras’ organized crime underworld. The drug traffickers that testified against him said that Tony granted them protection and managed drug shipments.At their peak, the Valle Valle brothers -- Tony’s most important associates -- were the principal Honduran contact for Colombian, Guatemalan, and Mexican trafficking groups. During Tony’s trial in the United States, the prosecutors asserted that former Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo,” had personally delivered $1 million to Tony for his brother’s campaign.Tony also had links to the Cachiros trafficking group, which operated in Honduras’ north. Other traffickers associated with Tony include Víctor Hugo Díaz Morales, alias “El Rojo” and Héctor Emilio Fernández Rosa, alias “Don H,” an associate of the Valle Valle brothers.Alliances with the Honduran state were absolutely critical for Tony. Under Juan Orlando’s government, Tony enlisted the help of former police chief Juan Carlos “El Tigre” Bonilla, who allegedly provided protection services for drug traffickers. Mauricio Hernández Pineda, a former police officer and an extended family member of Tony’s, also helped provide security services.Other local politicians accused of drug trafficking who figured into Tony’s contacts included Alexander Ardón, the former mayor of El Paraíso, and Mario José Cálix Hernández, the former vice mayor of Gracias in Lempira department.","The case of Tony Hernandez illuminated just how deeply organized crime has infiltrated the National Party’s most recent governments and illustrated how drug trafficking proceeds are used to maintain power.The sentencing of Tony Hernández eliminated him and many of his state associates from Honduras’ criminal map. This has left it unclear who sits in charge of the country’s drug trafficking business at the highest levels.Following the captures and extraditions of Honduras’ major kingpins, drug trafficking in the country has fractured and there remains no dominant group. A few small “criminal fiefdoms” have formed in strategic areas of the country, where politicians and other important actors control drug flows through their territories.On the other hand, Tony’s sentencing has put his brother, President Juan Orlando Hernández -- who relies on the United States’ support for his presidency -- in a precarious position. The president of Honduras has criticized that the accusations against his brother, some of which implicate him as well, are unfounded and based on the testimony of drug traffickers.Juan Orlando Hernández’s presidential term ends in 2021, and he supposedly will not be seeking reelection. It remains to be seen if organized crime can maintain its position in the Honduran political system without the Hernández clan in power."
"Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia, alias 'Don Lucho'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/luis-agustin-caicedo-velandia-alias-don-lucho/,Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia,Don Lucho,./images/individuals/luis-agustin-caicedo-velandia.jpg,2021-07-16,['colombia personalities'],colombia,"For some two decades, Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia, alias “Don Lucho,” is alleged to have played a significant role in trafficking drugs out of Colombia’s prized Eastern Plains region, relying on key alliances with some of the country’s most powerful criminal players to move cocaine through Central America and the Caribbean and on to lucrative markets in the United States and Europe. However, as a so-called “invisible” largely hidden in the shadows, his true role in Colombia’s drug trade remains uncertain.Caicedo was assassinated in Bogotá along with another man on July 16, 2021.","Don Lucho reportedly entered the drug trafficking world around 1994 after leaving the Colombian Attorney General Office's Technical Body of Investigation (Cuerpo Tecnico de Investigacion - CTI) amid a scandal regarding his alleged participation in the escape of a Puerto Rican drug trafficker. Authorities in the United States also trace his criminal career back to at least the mid- to late-1990s, eventually rising to become a key part of a criminal organization known as the El Dorado Cartel, El Cartel de Bogotá or simply the Junta, within which Don Lucho was a master of logistics.Primarily through connections to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Revolucionarias de Colombia -- FARC) and United Self-Defense Forces (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia -- AUC), he arranged for cocaine to be processed, produced and delivered to transportation cells on the north and west coasts of Colombia before arranging for the drugs to be transported via maritime routes to Central America and on to Mexican traffickers for importation into the United States, or through Venezuela and the Caribbean to Europe, according to US prosecutors.Don Lucho trafficked tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of kilograms of cocaine during his tenure, allowing him to amass a fortune worth hundreds of millions of dollars in the process.Throughout the 2000s, according to Colombian authorities, Don Lucho is believed to have trafficked cocaine alongside Daniel Barrera Barrera, alias “El Loco,” who relied on a vast network of collaborators to run one of Colombia’s most formidable drug trafficking networks since the fall of Medellín Cartel kingpin Pablo Escobar. However, some US anti-drug officials believe that Don Lucho and El Loco each had their own sophisticated trafficking networks that worked beside one another while respecting each other’s operations. Like feudal kings, they knew alliances were necessary to fight off security forces and encroachments by other organized crime groups.However, while appearing to be among the major leagues of Colombia’s drug trafficking world, Don Lucho’s name rarely figured prominently into newspaper headlines prior to his arrest. By all accounts, he was part of what InSight Crime has identified as the “invisibles,” a new generation of drug traffickers operating with a low profile and under the assumption that their best protection is total anonymity.Whatever the case, Don Lucho managed a quite profitable drug business for years, which featured a money laundering wing that extended into Spain and washed more than $1 billion in drug proceeds between 2005 and 2009, according to Spanish police.Don Lucho’s criminal career came to an end in June 2010. In a joint operation, US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agents and Argentine security forces captured him at a shopping center in Buenos Aires. He was later extradited to the United States the following month.Once in US custody, Don Lucho pleaded guilty to a five-count drug trafficking indictment in Florida and received a 10-year prison sentence. His sentence was later reduced down to time served in 2015 due to his cooperation. However, Don Lucho also faced an indictment in New York with El Loco and others on a money laundering conspiracy that involved more than $175 million in drug proceeds, according to prosecutors.Don Lucho again pleaded guilty and cooperated with US authorities, so much so that prosecutors called his contributions “beyond magnificent,” adding that he helped bring down his own network and other Colombian traffickers while also aiding in the seizure of more than $100 million in assets, thousands of kilograms of cocaine and a number of go-fast boats and semi-submersibles.On January 30, 2019, Don Lucho walked free from jail in New York, according to the US Federal Bureau of Prisons, and returned to Colombia. ","Don Lucho was a substantial drug trafficker and money launderer who walked a fine line between two of Colombia’s most powerful criminal groups, making connections with both the FARC and AUC to facilitate his operations.It’s clear that Don Lucho worked closely with El Loco, who would buy cocaine paste from the FARC and then process that into cocaine in his own labs in the Eastern Plains, some of which was then sold to the AUC, who used the drugs to purchase weapons and other materials, according to US prosecutors. It’s likely that Don Lucho utilized a similar strategy.When not selling drugs to the AUC, Don Lucho relied on a variety of trafficking methods to move his product outside of Colombia, including via semi-submersibles, non-commercial airplanes, cargo, vessels and land transportation organizations that worked alongside his group, according to a special agent from the DEA.When not departing Colombia directly from key Pacific port cities like Tumaco, Don Lucho also moved his cocaine through Venezuela and the Caribbean en route to Europe, or via Central America and Mexico to the United States. He even seems to have operated from Argentina, where he was eventually arrested.US authorities alleged Don Lucho had connections to some of the most significant drug money launderers in Colombia that dealt with hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in drug proceeds, some of whom Don Lucho himself allegedly helped bring down.For his part, Don Lucho still holds the record for having the world’s largest known drug money laundering operation estimated at more than $1.5 billion, according to the Guinness Book of World Records.","Don Lucho operated primarily in the Eastern Plains region of Colombia, but was also linked to the country’s Atlantic and Pacific coasts, as well as to drugs departing from El Dorado International Airport in the capital, Bogotá. But the tentacles of his criminal organization didn’t stop there, but rather extended throughout the region. From across the border in Venezuela, to Honduras in Central America, Haiti in the Caribbean and also Mexico, Don Lucho’s network touched every key point in the drug trafficking chain for coca cultivation and cocaine production on up to vital departure and transshipment points, according to information cited in court documents.On the money laundering side, Don Lucho’s network set up a substantial operation headed by his wife in Spain in order to launder drug proceeds from Colombia, Mexico and Panama. One of the fake companies set up to launder the money also allegedly bought gold and pawned jewels.","In Colombia, Don Lucho’s primarily alliance was with El Loco, but he also relied on connections with members of the FARC and AUC throughout the 2000s. One of his key points of contact within the FARC’s ranks was Tomas Molina Caracas, alias “Negro Acacio,” who was the head of the rebels’ 16th Front in Vichada department. Until his death in 2007, Negro Acacio funded the FARC’s Eastern Bloc primarily through drug proceeds.In addition to the 16th Front, Don Lucho also enjoyed protection from the FARC’s 1st and 43rd Fronts. Outside of the FARC and AUC, the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia (Ejército Revolucionario Popular Antiterrorista Colombiano – ERPAC), led by Pedro Oliverio Guerrero, alias “Cuchillo,” also guarded Don Lucho’s operations and drug processing centers in Meta, Guaviare and Vichada departments, according to Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office.Don Lucho was also tied to a number of other Colombian capos. This included Julio Alberto Lozano Pirateque, who under the facade of being a prosperous emerald merchant laundered money through various companies and properties, as well as Claudio Javier Silva Otálora, alias “Patrón,” who rose through the drug trafficking ranks with the help of former Norte del Valle head Wílber Varela, alias “Jabón.” Otálora and Pirateque were both indicted with Don Lucho in the Eastern District of New York in 2010 in connection to a money laundering conspiracy. Colombian authorities reportedly seized some $28 million of money linked to the men in the Pacific coast port city of Buenaventura in 2010.Outside of Colombia, Don Lucho had a close criminal relationship with Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel, which relied on his network that extended through Colombia and Venezuela and into Central America and the Caribbean in order to obtain the cocaine the group moved into the United States. In fact, authorities in May 2010 reportedly intercepted a submarine Don Lucho had sent from Colombia stuffed with more than a ton of cocaine for Sinaloa Cartel kingpins Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán and Ismael Zambada García, alias “El Mayo.”After his arrest in 2010 in Buenos Aires, Don Lucho made quite a few enemies after providing US prosecutors with a treasure trove of information on members of his own organization, as well as other rival traffickers. He informed US law enforcement about drug trafficking routes, disclosed where associates were hiding, identified at least 126 individuals for federal prosecutors, recorded phone conversations with traffickers and was set to be a witness in several trials.His cooperation almost certainly aided Colombian authorities in the capture of El Loco Barrera in September 2012. However, many of the enemies Don Lucho made are likely behind bars or dead.","All the evidence suggests that Don Lucho was likely one of Colombia’s most powerful and sophisticated drug traffickers, just without all the public notoriety. He amassed considerable power and wealth hidden in the shadows behind El Loco as an “invisible,” and InSight Crime sources say there’s some indication he may have even jumped back into the business after returning to Colombia following his release from jail in January 2019.Although Don Lucho sang like a bird for US prosecutors, many of those he implicated are either dead or jailed, and it’s unlikely anyone is actively seeking to take him out at the moment. Even if they were, Don Lucho grew accustomed to successfully operating below the surface amid threats to his life.Caicedo was assassinated in Bogotá along with another man on July 16, 2021. "
"José Antonio Yépez Ortiz, alias 'El Marro'",https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/jose-antonio-yepez-ortiz-alias-el-marro/,José Antonio Yépez Ortiz,El Marro,./images/individuals/josé-antonio-yépez-ortiz.jpg,2020-08-03,['mexico personalities'],mexico,"José Antonio Yépez Ortiz, alias “El Marro,” is the leader of the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel and one of those most responsible for the growing violence that has plagued the state of Guanajuato in 2019 and 2020.In addition to leading a tough fight against the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación - CJNG) in this region, he was one of Mexico’s most wanted criminals.He was captured by Mexican security forces in Guanajuato on August 2, 2020. He was sentenced to 60 years in prison in January 2022, a ruling that was ratified in October 2022. Despite his imprisonment, violence in Guanajuato has continued.","Yépez Ortiz was born in the town of Santa Rosa de Lima in the municipality of Villagrán, central Guanajuato state. Although it is unclear how he first got involved in crime, his name began to circulate in the media in 2017 when he appeared in a viral video in the company of dozens of armed men threatening the CJNG.His criminal rap sheet includes a 2008 arrest for theft and organized delinquency, although he did not serve his full sentence after paying an expensive bail bond and being released. In 2014, he dabbled in fuel theft as the second-in-command to David Figueroa, alias “El Güero,” a former high-ranking police officer, who has been identified as a founding member of the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel. By 2017, Yépez had assumed control of the organization and was already starting to gain notoriety after the conflict with the CJNG intensified over control of the oil theft business, known as “huachicoleo.” Since then, and unlike other oil theft gang leaders who maintain a lower profile, El Marro has become one of the leading names in the Mexican criminal underworld, despite the local nature of his organization. His notoriety led to the Mexican authorities declaring that bringing down the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel (CSRL) was a top priority. In 2019, President Andrés Manuel López Obrador announced the creation of a joint operation against the fuel smuggler aimed at dismantling the organization. While authorities tracked continuously, El Marro managed to escape several sting operations. In March 2019, when security forces made their way into the town of Santa Rosa de Lima, Yépez Ortiz reportedly managed to escape through a series of tunnels that connected his house with neighboring homes. In October 2019, authorities conducted a similar operation with no success.Attempts to arrest him were hampered in part by the fact that he counts on broad support among communities around Guanajuato, with protests and roadblocks organized to stop military operations to catch him. Nevertheless, authorities seized much of his assets and have captured several members from within his close circle, among them his father and his wife. Yépez Ortiz responded with violent demonstrations of power, including the murders of local public officials and roadblocks.He was finally arrested in August 2020 in Guanajuato.","As the leader of the CSRL, El Marro directed fuel theft operations in the state of Guanajuato, the cartel’s center of operations. While this is the CSRL's lifeblood, it has also engaged in extortion.It is estimated that the organization at its height could extract between 40 and 50 barrels of fuel a day from the pipes belonging to the national oil company Pemex, which could bring in estimated profits of $800,000-$1.2 million a day.The CSRL's capacity to steal important quantities of fuel and move it on has been made evident through the seizures of several fleets of vehicles containing numerous barrels of fuel, pick-up trucks and more than 200 cars.Following these successive crackdowns on fuel thieves in 2019, the CSRL saw itself squeezed financially and the group has expanded its criminal portfolio, profiting from other activities such as kidnapping, contract killings, extortion, money laundering and drug trafficking.","The organization gets its name from the community of Santa Rosa de Lima in the municipality of Villagrán, the area where it was created in central Guanajuato state.The CSRL had a strong presence in the municipalities of Celaya, Salamanca, Santa Cruz, Juventino Rosas, Irapuato and Valle de Santiago.Its fighting with the CJNG has largely taken place in a corridor encompassing the municipalities of León, Salamanca, Irapuato, Celaya and Los Apaseos, an area with plenty of pipelines belonging to Pemex. It has also regularly carried out oil theft in the neighboring states of Queretaro and Hidalgo.The group’s extortion activities are concentrated in the most populated and prosperous municipalities, like Celaya and San Miguel de Allende.","Since 2017, the CSRL has waged a deathly battle against the CJNG in the state of Guanajuato, ever since the latter began seeking to aggressively take over oil theft in the region.The battle between the cartels has increased violence in Guanajuato, making it the most murderous state in Mexico in 2019. The local nature of the CSRL has allowed Yépez Ortiz to build alliances within the communities where his cartel operates, by giving gifts to local politicians and offering payments to local residents who, in addition to collaborating with his criminal enterprise, may offer a degree of protection. Within the criminal underworld, there are unconfirmed reports of El Marro receiving help from El Mayo, the leader of the Sinaloa Cartel, as well as protection from Los Viagras, a group with roots in Michoacán. These allies may support the CSRL by loaning materials and manpower to support the fight against the CJNG, a common enemy.  ","Although El Marro long managed to stay one step ahead of the law, the CSRL was unable to withstand the sustained onslaught of government attacks and persistent clashes with the CJNG.Although President Andrés Manuel López Obrador openly spoke about not wishing to go to war with criminal gangs in Mexico, he made ending oil theft a focal point of his security strategy, especially bringing down El Marro.Yépez Ortiz suffered important losses, with his bank accounts frozen and many of the organization’s assets seized, as well as the arrests and murders of members of his inner circle, before himself being captured in August 2020."
"Marcelo Fernando Pinheiro Veiga, alias 'Piloto'",https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/marcelo-fernando-pinheiro-veiga-alias-piloto/,Marcelo Fernando Pinheiro Veiga,Piloto,./images/individuals/marcelo-fernando-pinheiro-veiga.jpg,2020-04-13,"['brazil personalities', 'paraguay personalities']",paraguay,"Marcelo Pinheiro, alias ""Piloto,"" was considered one of the Brazilian government’s most sought-after drug traffickers until 2017. He is believed to have been the second-in-command of the Red Command (Comando Vermelho - CV).As the direct heir to the operations led by the CV’s founder, Fernandinho Beira-Mar, Pinheiro became one of the top drug-trafficking leaders along the land border between Paraguay (Pedro Juan Caballero) and Brazil (Punta Porá). Taking advantage of border facilities and weaknesses within the Paraguayan state, Piloto’s crimes ranged from large-scale theft to murder, the purchase and sale of illegal weapons, falsification of documents and drug trafficking. He was apprehended on December 13, 2017, in Itapuá, Paraguay, by a joint operation between Paraguayan and Brazilian special forces.He was extradited to Brazil on November 19, 2018, following the homicide of Lidia Meza Burgos.","Born in 1975, in the favela of Urubu, Pilares, Río de Janeiro, Marcelo Pinheiro  He started out as a common thief in the 1990s, participating in robberies called ""bondes,"" meaning “trams,” were conducted in the Norte do Rio region, where he was in charge of getaway vehicles. This was how he earned his nickname, “Piloto.”Local press reports claim that he got his start in small scale drug-trafficking in the mid-90s. He was arrested in 1998 and sentenced to 26 years in prison. On August 24, 2007, he obtained the right to serve his sentence under a semi-open prison regime. He was sent to a low-security prison: the Edgard Costa Criminal Institute, in the city of Niterói, Río de Janeiro, from which he escaped and returned to illicit activities in Río de Janeiro.Already a fugitive, he entered into large-scale drug trafficking within the communities of Manguinhos and Mandela I, II and III. His main focus was in the city of Rio de Janeiro, where the Red Command had been exercising control for a decade. In July 2012, he orchestrated the rescue of drug trafficker Diogo de Souza Feitoza, alias DG, who was later killed. This same year, after the occupation of the Manguinhos favela by security forces, Marcelo fled to Paraguay. He then started to use a false identity and to change his address every six months to stay one step ahead of Paraguayan and Brazilian police. For Piloto, Paraguay represented a land of opportunities, corruption and impunity. One month before his extradition, he told the country’s press that in 2015m he paid an official from Alto Paraná $200,000 for his freedom as well as $10,000 for a fake ID, although “this documentation was not very good, because I don’t speak Spanish or Guarani well,” he told the media outlet Extra.In Paraguay, he dedicated himself to smugging arms and drugs, like marijuana and cocaine, towards Brazilian cities controlled by the Red Command. His primary operations base was Ciudad del Este as well as Pedro Juan Caballero, a city bordering Brazil.Despite Piloto being identified as a leader of the CV, an event that took place in Ciudad del Este on April 24, 2017, generated confusion among authorities. Piloto is believed to have provided the logistical support for a large-scale assault on the private security agency Prosegur, an event carried out by rival group, the First Capital Command (Primer Comando Capital - PCC). Subsequently, Paraguayan prosecutors assumed that Pinheiro, rather than being a Red Command leader in Paraguay, was really more of a contractor for any group requiring his services. On December 13, 2017, Piloto was arrested in the Paraguayan city of Encarnación during a joint operation conducted by Brazilian and Paraguayan police. Since his arrest and until his extradition, Brazilian and Paraguayan forces thwarted at least six attempts to free the drug trafficker. Paraguayan police investigations concluded that Piloto had devised a plan to remain in prison in Paraguay, as it would be easier for him to stage a prison break there. He therefore began claiming responsibility for crimes committed in the country, like the 2013 murder of one of his transporters, Miguel Aranda, in Alto Paraná. His goal was to avoid extradition to Brazil. However, on October 26, 2018, Paraguayan judge Alicia Pedrozo authorized Piloto’s extradition to Brazil. Once he learned of the court’s decision, the Brazilian trafficker murdered a young woman named Lidia Meza Burgos, a victim of a sex trafficking ring who was a sex worker in the maximum-security prison. Pinheiro bludgeoned her and stabbed her 16 times. As soon as the murder was reported, Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benítez ordered Pinheiro’s extradition for November 19, 2018. ","In Brazil, Piloto has been linked to large scale robbery and micro-trafficking. After his escape from federal prison in Brazil in 2007, his underworld skills transitioned into arms and drug trafficking, train assaults, extortion and attacks on public facilities and he went on to become one of the heads of the Red Command, head of the criminal association.Pinheiro continued with his criminal activities after fleeing to Paraguay in 2012. He focused on the trafficking of drugs and weapons, setting himself up as a facilitator for other criminal groups like the PCC. Piloto provided the weaponry for the aforementioned attack on Prosegur conducted by the PCC. The explosives and high caliber weapons arrived in Pedro Juan Caballero on a small plane, where Piloto helped load the vehicles that transported to Ciudad del Este for the attack. In Paraguay he worked as a criminal “freelancer,” offering services to a range of criminal groups.","In Brazil, Piloto moved within the Norte do Río region in Río de Janeiro, in the communities of Manguinhos and Mandela I, II and III. In Paraguay, he moved between the cities of Pedro Juan Caballero (on the border with Brazil), Ciudad del Este (Triple Frontier) and Encarnación (bordering Argentina). Therefore, he moved through practically all of the eastern part of the country. ","As one of the leaders of the CV, Pinheiro’s main rival during his years in Brazil was the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC). Once in Paraguay, there is evidence he collaborated with both groups. He loaned services to whoever asked, and there were no conflicts with other factions or disputes with other rival gangs or clans. His influence also extended into an enormous corruption network within the Paraguayan National Police, as he relied on the complicity of agency officials. During a press conference on November 6, 2018, he stated: “I point directly to police commissioner Abel Cañete, from Ciudad del Este, who I paid every month for protection […] Police personnel were responsible for warning me each time authorities from the neighboring country crossed the border.”","Pinheiro has been arrested and is being tried in Brazil. He is now being held at the Catanduvas prison, in the state of Paraná. He is accused of drug trafficking, theft, armed robbery, homicide and criminal associations. In June 2019, Federal Criminal Court in Río de Janeiro agreed to try him for the murder of Lidia Meza Burgos. For this crime alone, prosecutors demanded a sentence of 30 years in prison. "
"Gilberto Aparecido Dos Santos, alias 'Fuminho'",https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/gilberto-aparecido-dos-santos-alias-fuminho/,Gilberto Aparecido Dos Santos,Fuminho,./images/individuals/gilberto-aparecido-dos-santos.jpg,2020-04-13,"['brazil personalities', 'pcc']",brazil,"Gilberto Aparecido Dos Santos, alias ""Fuminho,"" is a close ally to the leadership of Brazil’s largest and most powerful criminal organization, the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC).He oversees the movement of cocaine and firearms from Bolivia and Paraguay to the gang-controlled states of Brazil. While not believed to be an official member of the PCC leadership, Fuminho was a top provider of drugs to the gang and a close friend of Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho, alias “Marcola,” who has led the organization from various prisons since 2002. He was arrested in Mozambique in April 2020.","While it remains unclear whether he was ever officially initiated into the PCC, Fuminho has been working with Marcola since the early 1990s, when they made a living out of bank robberies and car theft. Fuminho broke out of Casa de Detenção prison in 1999, around the time that Marcola was climbing the ranks of the PCC.Following his escape, Fuminho fled Brazil. However, his official whereabouts remained unconfirmed until 2008, when he used a fake identity to gain entry into Bolivia. Fuminho appears to have settled in Bolivia before then, spending the decade developing a base of operations in the country’s coca-producing Chapare region. Here, Fuminho was able to train PCC members and oversee the transport of arms and cocaine paste through Paraguay to the Brazilian states of Ceará, Pernambuco and Santa Catarina, among others.In February 2014, Fuminho planned to free Marcola from the Presidente Venceslau prison outside of São Paolo using a helicopter painted with military designs. But officials discovered the plan and relocated Marcola and other PCC inmates.That same year, Fuminho came close to being arrested after São Paulo police broke up a money laundering scheme involving around 40 PCC members. One of them, Wilson José Lima de Oliveira, “alias Neno,” fled to Fuminho’s home in Florida. The DEA were on the verge of raiding the property when he and Neno boarded a plane to Panama.Fuminho rose to second-in-command in early 2018 following the fall of several high-ranking PCC gang members. That February, Fuminho arranged for the execution of Rogério Jeremias de Simone, alias ""Gegê do Mangue,"" and Fabiano Alves de Souza, alias ""Paca,"" who were stealing money from the organization. In the same month, Elton Leonel Rumich da Silva, alias ""Galán,"" who helped oversee the transport of arms and drugs through Bolivia and Paraguay, was arrested in Rio de Janeiro, thereby securing Fuminho’s position as the top free member of the PCC.In 2018, Fuminho planned a second attempt to break Marcola out. This one, officials said, was to involve cutting power to the surrounding area, landing a helicopter at the prison gates and flying Marcola to a local airstrip for transfer to Paraguay or Bolivia. However, once prison officials learned of the plan, Marcola and other incarcerated PCC members were quickly relocated to other prisons.","Fuminho’s exact whereabouts were for a long time difficult to pinpoint. Most reports placed him in Bolivia’s Chapare region, with occasional business trips to the Brazilian states of Mato Grosso do Sul and Minas Gerais. However, there has also been reporting that in 2019 Fuminho left Bolivia for Paraguay, where the PCC’s influence is stronger and he can more closely oversee the transport of drugs to Mato Grosso do Sul. Regardless, he maintained control over much of the drug and arms trafficking activity in eastern Bolivia, Paraguay and nearly all Brazilian states.He was surprisingly located in Mozambique, Africa, and arrested in April 2020.","Fuminho remains close to Marcola, who gives him direction from prison. Until his arrest in April 2020, Fuminho was one of Brazil's most-wanted criminals. Despite having ties to the PCC leadership, he operated independently of Marcola, for example by allegedly arranging the executions of Gegê del Mangue and Paca.Fuminho’s presence in Bolivia has relied on connections to its government officials, prisons and law enforcement. He also reportedly had a growing relationship with the ‘Ndrangheta, an Italian mafia group that met with him in 2016 and 2017 to arrange shipments to Europe.",Fuminho appeared on Brazil’s 25 Most Wanted List in January 2020. While he took measures to avoid capture—officials say he took his fingerprint records with him upon escape in 1999—he was arrested in April 2020 in Mozambique.,

He ultimately became one of the top commanders of the FARC’s Eastern Bloc. Zarco Aldinever has joined a new dissident force made up of former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) commanders, including Luciano Marín, alias “Iván Márquez,"" who announced their return to arms in August 2019.","Sierra Sabogal is a native of Villavicencio in the department of Meta. He joined the guerillas in 1990, when he was just 14 years old.He began training at a camp known as “Hernando González Acosta,” founded in 1984 by Manuel Marulanda Vélez, alias ""Tiro Fijo,"" and Jorge Briceño, alias ""Mono Jojoy."" At the camp, which schooled him in arms and ideological teachings, Zarco Aldinever earned the trust of Mono Jojoy.In 1998, along with Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias ""Romaña,"" Zarco Aldinever participated in a large-scale kidnapping orchestrated by the FARC, which took place along a national highway that connects Bogotá and the Eastern Plains. Zarco Aldinever’s ties to Mono Jojoy led to him become part of the FARC's leadership. As commander of the infamous 53rd Front, he was in charge of the central Meta department, a FARC stronghold. He also had influence over a rural area south of the capital of Bogotá, where he was responsible for recruitment efforts and extortion.After Mono JoyJoy's death in 2010, Zarco Aldinever was seen as his successor within the Eastern Bloc. He also established a friendship with Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias ""El Paisa,"" and the pair worked together on the FARC's cocaine trafficking operations. Zarco Aldinever took part in the peace process between the Colombian government that began with a peace agreement in 2016. He -- along with Alberto Cruz Lobo, alias ""Enrique Marulanda,"" -- was in charge of the Mesetas reintegration camp in Meta, where he oversaw the demobilization of 500 fighters. In late 2018, however, he left the reintegration camp, ending his participation in the peace process. About the same time, El Paisa also went missing. Zarco Aldinever later reappeared in a 2019 video announcing a new dissident force composed of ex-FARC leaders. A Colombian general speculated that Zarco Alidinever was operating in the Venezuelan state of Apure.","As the commander of various fronts in Meta, Zarco Aldinever was charged with taxing coca and cocaine production and controlling smuggling routes. He allegedly participated in the 1999 attack against the Army’s mobile base in Gutiérrez, Cundinamarca, which left 18 soldiers dead. He was also involved in the 2011 kidnapping and murder of college student Edson Paez Serna. Additionally, Zarco Aldinever has various criminal cases pending, including for extortion and assaults in the towns of Cabrera, Venecia and Gutiérrez and the rural areas of Sumapaz. He also has been charged with multiple attacks against public security forces in Meta and Cundinamarca.","During his time with the FARC, Zarco Aldinever tried to retake areas of Cundinamarca that the group lost control of in 2007. His base of operations was the border between the mountains of Sumapaz and the department of Meta. He also helped the group spread into the regions of Meta, Cundinamarca and Boyacá.","Zarco Aldinever was a protege of Mono Jojoy and maintained close ties with him until his death. He commanded the Eastern Bloc with Jaime Alberto Parra Rodríguez, alias ""Mauricio el Médico,"" and was a close associate of El Paisa. In 2012, a criminal network was discovered in the Plains that included the FARC’s 53rd Front, Mexican drug traffickers, and allies of alias ""Romaña.” Zarco Aldinever had ties to other guerrilla leaders, including Ferley Rondón Marín, alias ""Robin,"" who participated in various campaigns (El Billar in Caquetá, Puerto Rico in Meta and Algeciras in Huila) until he was killed in 2013. Zarco Aldinever also counted on longtime FARC fighter Jaime Aguilar Ramírez, alias ""Dionisio Rayo,"" an explosives expert and political advisor who was arrested in 2013.","Thanks to his experience with the Eastern Bloc, Zarco Aldinever stands to become a force for the ex-FARC Mafia in the Eastern Plains, although his former area of operations is currently controlled by other criminal groups. He has deep knowledge of the FARC's drug trafficking operations and routes in the departments of Meta, Cundinamarca and Boyacá. Additionally, his long command within the FARC sets him up as a likely leader in the new dissident force. "

However, in August 2019, he appeared in a video alongside Iván Márquez and other former guerrilla leaders, announcing their formal abandonment of the peace process and return to arms in the creation of a group known as the Second Marquetalia (Segunda Marquetalia).He has remained mostly off the radar since but allegedly took over leadership of the Second Marquetalia in July 2022, following the reported death of Iván Márquez.","Walter Mendoza joined the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC)) in the 1970s. He was influential in creating much of the group's structure, including the Joint Central Command and the Mobile Columns, which became the guerrilla group's ""elite troops,"" carrying out crucial military and criminal operations across the country.His criminal history began in the Western Bloc, operating in the departments of Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Chocó, located along Colombia's Pacific coast. He also led the Libardo García Mobile Column in Buenaventura, Valle del Cauca.Mendoza was responsible, along with Diego Ardila Merchán, alias ""Leonel Paz,"" for a motorcycle bomb attack in the municipality of Pradera, Valle del Cauca, in 2014, which killed one person and injured 56 others.He was an early critic of the peace process and there was doubt whether he would participate in peace talks between the government and the FARC in 2014. He fueled this speculation in a video where he vowed that his men would never hand over their weapons.However, after the peace agreement was signed, he became an active participant, being in charge of implementing the peace process among the demobilizing FARC members in southern and western Colombia.Mendoza gained further notoriety by giving interviews to various media organizations and participating in a documentary about the peace process. He spoke calmly about his days in the FARC and the tactics he implemented, including about the Mobile Columns.""When there is more mobility the guerrilla is more offensive [...] a single guerrilla unit can attack up to three times a day [...] the regular army has to walk in large units.""Mendoza also reportedly had plans to branch out into other ventures, including setting up a project to export coffee or becoming the coach of soccer teams made up of demobilized FARC fighters.But in August 2018, he was arrested on charges of manufacturing, trafficking and illegally carrying firearms and ammunition, although he was released days later due to inconsistencies in the arrest procedure.By late 2018, he was facing at least eight different arrest warrants for a range of crimes, most of them in Valle del Cauca. inconsistencies in the procedure.Shortly afterward, he vanished and his whereabouts remained unknown until the August 2019 video announcing the return to arms of key FARC leaders, including Luciano Marín Arango, alias ""Iván Márquez,"" Seuxis Pausías Hernández, alias ""Jesús Santrich,"" and Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias ""El Paisa.""He has remained largely off the radar since, even when most of his fellow leaders of the Second Marquetalia were progressively killed off in 2021 and 2022. According to Colombian media sources, he allegedly became the leader of the group in July 2022.","Mendoza's biggest contribution to the FARC was the creation of the Mobile Columns. This tactic allowed FARC units to operate with greater autonomy and versatility.But Mendoza was also involved in drug trafficking, extortion and attacks on the civilian population in the departments of Cauca and Valle del Cauca.Since joining the Second Marquetalia, it is uncertain precisely what his criminal responsibilities have been. However, he must have retained a strong degree of influence, since he has allegedly been seen as the natural successor to Iván Márquez.","However, his command of the Libardo García Mobile Column meant that his seat of operations was in Buenaventura, capital of Valle del Cauca. But his broader actions within the Western Bloc meant that he operated across the departments of Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Chocó.During the peace process, he integrated the Territorial Space for Training and Reincorporation (Espacio Territorial de Capacitación y Reincorporación – ETCR) of La Elvira, in Cauca, but visited multiple departments as a trainer and promoter of the peace agreements until he abandoned the process in 2019.His movements within the Second Marquetalia have been unknown. While the group was strongest along the Colombia-Venezuela border, specifically in Arauca and Apure, it is uncertain if Mendoza has also been based there or has remained in his Cauca stronghold.","As part of the Western Bloc, he was close to Jorge Torres Victoria, alias ""Pablo Catatumbo,"" who became his second-in-command within the Libardo García Mobile Column. Additionally, he is known to have had a close relationship with Leonel Paz.His closest allies were those who alongside him in the August 2019 video, including former FARC commanders, Iván Márquez and Jesús Santrich. But with almost all of the Second Marquetalia leadership having been killed, he may find himself dangerously exposed.","Walter Mendoza possesses in-depth tactical, military and political knowledge, making him a real asset to the ex-FARC Mafia and giving him authority in the ranks of those who have answered Márquez's call.As a negotiator to the FARC's peace talks and having temporarily been in charge of implementing parts of peace process, he knows Colombia's political landscape very well. However, his true background among the FARC was more on the military side of operations than the political.Therefore, if it is confirmed that he has taken over leadership of the Second Marquetalia, he may not prioritize pursuing any political goals, especially given how weak the group has become with the deaths of so many key leaders."
"Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias 'Romaña'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/henry-castellanos-garzon-alias-romana/,Henry Castellanos Garzón,Romaña,./images/individuals/henry-castellanos-garzón.jpg,2021-12-09,"['colombia personalities', 'ex-farc mafia']",colombia,"Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias “Romaña,” was the commander of the 53rd Front of the now-defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and then a leading figure within the Segunda Marquetalia dissident group.Romaña was also known for his participation in well-known attacks, such as the 1998 seizure of Mitú, and for joining the Eastern Bloc of the guerrilla’s Greater Central State (Estado Mayor Central – EMC). He was also part of the 2014 delegation sent to advance the peace talks in Cuba between the national government and the guerrillas.He later defected from the FARC’s demobilization camps and reappeared in a video in which he announced the creation of a new dissident group made up of former guerrilla leaders.In December 2021, Venezuelan and Colombian media reported that Romaña was killed in Venezuela's western department of Apure, alongside one of his closest allies, Hernán Darío Velásquez, better known as ""El Paisa."" This news was later confirmed by Colombia's Defense Minister as photos of Romaña's body circulated online.","Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias “Romaña,” was born on March 20, 1965 in the municipality of El Castillo, in the Meta department. There are various versions of the story of his early life. According to the most likely of these stories, he only studied up until the fourth grade and spent his youth in Bogotá, where he joined the Communist Youths (Juventudes Comunistas - Juco).In Bogotá, his activity with the Juco took place in the neighborhoods located to the south of the city. Under investigation by authorities, and faced with imminent capture, Romaña joined the FARC, where he stood out for his ability to create explosive devices.Jorge Briceño, alias ‘Mono Jojoy,’ was Romaña’s mentor within the insurgency.  He also met Manuel Marulanda Vélez, commander in chief of the guerrilla. It is said that he was one of Marulanda’s star students within the special command trainings, and according to witness testimonies, they worked very well together.Romaña’s first court records date back to 1982, when he led the FARC’s 11th Front and ordered the murder of some one hundred people in the Río Guaguaquí region bordering the departments of Cundinamarca and Boyacá.He was later transferred to the 53rd Front. The Front started to become important in 1993 as a result of the attacks they conducted on the route connecting Bogotá and Villavicencio. Within one year, Romaña rose through the ranks to become commander of the entire front.His Front’s activity along this route was based on illegal check points, murders, kidnappings of police and military officers and multiple robberies.In one of the most well-known instances, the 53rd Front, under Romaña’s command, killed two people and kidnapped another 32 along the route. Among those kidnapped were an Italian and four North Americans, three of whom were executed after being accused of espionage. In response, the US government asked for the extradition of the guerrilla commandant.These kidnappings started to become known as “pescas milagrosas,” or “miracle fishing,” due to the random selection of victims. These kidnappings became a lucrative source of funding for the FARC.Romaña’s newfound recognition earned him roles in important FARC operations, such as the seizure of Mitú, the capital of the Vaupés department, where the guerrilla attacked the city, killing 16 police officers, 14 military officers and 11 civilians, and kidnapping 61 police officers.Romaña was later appointed as head of security of the buffer zone during the 1998 peace talks between the government and guerrilla group delegates.There is little information about Romaña’s activities from this moment up until 2010. In fact, it was believed that he had died in an operation along with Mono Jojoy. However, further information later ruled out the possibility of his alleged death.Romaña then joined the Eastern Bloc of the guerrilla’s EMC and became a member of the delegation sent to Cuba in 2014 to promote the peace talks between the national government and the guerilla. In Colombia, he led the demobilization efforts in Tumaco, in the department of Nariño, where there was no state presence during the conflict.In March 2019, he failed to appear before the Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz - JEP). Romaña’s whereabouts were unknown from this moment on, until he appeared in a video on August 29, 2019, alongside Luciano Marín Arango, alias ‘Iván Márquez,’ Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias ‘El Paisa,’ and Seuxis Pausias Hernández, alias ‘Jesús Santrich,’ announcing their return to arms.By December 2021, the progress of the Second Marquetalia has stalled in its tracks. Santrich, El Paisa and Romaña are all dead, depriving the group of much of its leadership and its legacy.","As the architect of the FARC’s ‘pescas milagrosas’ kidnappings, which became an important criminal economy for the guerrilla, and due to his key role in operations such as the takeover of Mitú, Romaña held significant weight within the group.Romaña has also participated in the FARC’s drug trafficking activities since the mid-1980s, as well as in the production, fabrication and distribution of hundreds of tons of cocaine sent to the United States and around the world.He was a crucial figure in the formation of the Segunda Marquetalia in 2019 and a leading figure within the ex-FARC Mafia until his death in December 2021.","Before joining the 53rd Front, Romaña transferred through the 26th, 27th, 40th and 51st Fronts, which operated in the Meta department and the southeastern part of Cundinamarca. The 53rd Front started to gain notorious force when he joined, due to its attacks on the routes connecting the cities of Bogotá and Villavicencio.Just like that, he became the second in command of a mixed structure made up of the 31st, 51st, 53rd, 54th, and 55th Fronts, as well as the Che Guevara Mobile Column, responsible for kidnappings and extortions in Cundinamarca.After his disappearance in 2018, authorities began to identify real estate belonging to Romaña, including 8 rural properties, located in Mesetas and La Uribe, in the Meta department, and 7 more located in the urban centers of Villavicencio and Fusagasugá, in the department of Cundinamarca. It was determined that the properties were all acquired by front men, and were the product of criminal activities related to drug trafficking, extortion and displacement.In January 2018, 50 rural farmers from the Ativa countryside of La Julia, in Meta, reported that Romaña had taken possession of the lands on which they lived.When he abandoned the peace process, sometime around September 2018, FARC members provided information locating him somewhere between Arauca and Norte de Santander, allegedly accompanied by some 80 men.","In the process of joining the FARC, Romaña formed relationships with guerrilla leaders like Pedro Antonio Marín Marín, better known by his alias, ‘Manuel Marulanda Vélez’ or ‘Tirofijo’ and Víctor Julio Suárez Rojas, alias ‘Jorge Briceño Suárez’ or ‘Mono Jojoy.’ He was also close to Carlos Arturo Osorio Velásquez, alias “Marco Aurelio Buendía,” member of the Greater Central State, and with his brother, Luis Alexis Castellanos Garzón, alias “Manguera,” commandant of the Manuela Beltrán Mobile Column, who was killed in 2003.In 2018, there were rumors of ties between Romaña and the Mora Urrea brothers, who for years were responsible for collecting and administering money for the FARC’s 53rd Front. According to the Attorney General’s Office, Romaña sent the money collected from extortions and kidnappings so that it could be legalized through commercial establishments.When he was in the Transitional Rural Normalization Zone (Zona Veredal Transitoria de Normalización - ZVTN) in Tumaco during the peace accords, Romaña took on the crisis of insubordinate mid-level commanders that wanted to continue their drug trafficking operations. He expelled 73 of these youths, all whom had contacts with Mexican drug traffickers and the Clan del Golfo. One of these young men was Patricio Arizala, alias “Guacho.”For one year, Guacho did as he pleased and seized territory, cornering even Romaña himself and threatening him. As a result, Romaña asked the government for special protection and abandoned the ZVTN.Romaña’s most important ally in his final years was Luciano Marín Arango, alias “Iván Márquez,” with whom he appeared in the video announcing the FARC’s return to arms, and with Jose Manuel Sierra, alias “Zarco Aldinever,” who committed crimes in various regions under Romaña’s control and joined several of the same Fronts, including the 53rd.The Second Marquetalia clashed increasingly with the 10th Front, another group of FARC dissidents loyal to Gentil Duarte. This appears to have led to Romaña’s death in a firefight with the 10th Front in Apure, Venezuela, in December 2021.","At one point, Romaña represented a constant source of fear for those within and outside of the FARC. For Colombians, he represented the indiscriminate offenses committed by the FARC and the creation of a devastating method for financing the group. However, Colombia’s kidnapping boom is now over, so it is not clear whether his experience with this practice is going to play a fundamental role in the activities of the group that returned to arms.On the other hand, he had extensive knowledge of the regions in the center of the country, particularly in the departments of Cundinamarca and Meta, as the person in charge of a route as important as that connecting Bogotá and Villavicencio.His death, alongside that of El Paisa, and coming on the heels of the killing of Jesús Santrich, may well mark the beginning of the end for the Second Marquetalia."
"Leider Johani Noscue, alias 'Mayimbú'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/leider-johani-noscue-alias-mayimbu/,Leider Johani Noscue,Mayimbú,./images/individuals/leider-johani-noscue.jpg,2019-11-08,"['colombia personalities', 'ex-farc mafia', 'ex-farc mafia']",colombia,"Leider Johani Noscue, known by his alias 'Mayimbú,' was one of the highest-value military targets in Colombia, based in the western department of Cauca. Noscue rose rapidly as a leader of the ex-FARC Mafia since leaving the peace process between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and the government, to become the head of the dissident Jaime Martínez Mobile Column focused on international drug trafficking. He was estimated to have around 100 armed men under his charge in the municipalities of Suárez, Corinto and Toribio, in Cauca, a crucial area for marijuana crops and an important drug trafficking throughpoint. He was killed in June 2022 during a raid on his stronghold in the town of Suárez.","Mayimbú joined the FARC in 2003 when he was just a boy and died at the age of 31. He was reportedly of Indigenous origin and was born in the municipality of Toribio in Cauca.He was trained by Edgar López Gómez, alias “Pacho Chino,” ex-leader of the FARC’s Sixth Front. He then began to make a reputation for himself, based on his involvement in a series of murders and violent kidnappings. His role in the guerrilla appears to have mostly consisted of gathering intelligence with urban areas and providing logistical support. On January 4, 2011, he was captured in Santander de Quilichao. He was charged with rebellion but managed to escape later that year.He was captured again in 2014, but returned to freedom at the end of 2017 after taking advantage of the amnesty program offered by Colombia's Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz - JEP).He commanded the Javier Martínez Mobile Column from 2018 to 2021, with the goal of uniting and leading ex-FARC dissidents in Cauca. Defense Minister Guillermo Botero confirmed that Mayimbú has ordered the murders of members of Indigenous communities in this department, such as that of indigenous governor Edwin Dagua Ipia in December 2018.
In September 2019, Karina García Sierra, a mayoral candidate in the community of Suárez, was found dead in a van along with several other occupants, including her mother. She had reportedly received threats and that she had been forced into meetings with Mayimbú in order to present her government plan.Initially, the Javier Martínez Mobile Column denied responsibility for the hit, a version of the story supported by an alleged pamphlet from the non-existent Sinaloa New Generation Cartel which claimed responsibility for the massacre. However, the pamphlet turned out to be fake, and the hoax has been blamed on Mayimbú. Mayimbú's men also repeatedly clashed in recent years with the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación - EPL) over the control of marijuana revenues in Cauca.This confrontation began to form as both groups sought to control the Golden Triangle, located between the municipalities of Corinto, Miranda and Caloto and one of Colombia's best marijuana production areas. Prior to his death in June 2022, the government was offering a reward of 150 million pesos ($45,000) for information leading to Mayimbú’s capture.","Mayimbú set himself up as a strongman in Cauca's marijuana-producing region of Corinto, Miranda and Caloto.Mayimbú had a criminal record that stretched to at least 15 murders, as well as kidnappings and terrorist attacks. In 2014, for example, he participated in the kidnappings of the daughter of a member of the public security forces and of two businessmen in the north of Cauca. Likewise, authorities have dismantled several illegal gold mines in the municipality of López de Micay that were under the control of the Jaime Martínez Column. More than a kilogram of gold was extracted every month in these illegal mines, generating close to 1.5 billion pesos ($440,000) annually. But the incident that brought Mayimbú to the forefront of Colombia's criminal landscape was the murder of Suárez’s mayoral candidate, Karina García, in September 2019.","Mayimbú first started to establish his influence in Toribio, Cauca, in 2010, when he claimed responsibility for the murder of two soldiers. He also participated in the kidnapping of three individuals in the municipalities of Guachené and Puerto Tejada, in northern Cauca.Mayimbú controlled the Golden Triangle of Marijuana, made up of the municipalities of Corinto, Miranda and Caloto, where he waged war against the EPL for control of the region, which he seemed to have won.Along with the pamphlet announcing the creation of the Jaime Martínez column, the group territorially divided northern Cauca. Its central mountain range has remained in the hands of the dissidents of the Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Column, with whom Mayimbú's group has had no conflicts, and the Jaime Martínez Column, which is concentrated in the Naya region. This location allowed Mayimbú to expand his territory into the municipalities of Suárez, Morales, Buenos Aires, Santander de Quilichao and López de Micay.In recent years, their actions also expanded to Valle del Cauca, where they settled in Buenaventura, Dagua and Jamundí.","Within the FARC, Mayimbú was trained by Édgar López Gómez, alias “Pacho Chino,” the former commander of the FARC’s 6th Front. There are also unconfirmed reports that his brother was a member of the FARC dissidence, before being arrested for extorting merchants in northern Cauca in May 2018.The main regional enemy of the Jaime Martínez Mobile Column has traditionally been the EPL, although there no recent information indicating the presence of this group in the territory and the National Liberation Army (Ejército Nacional de Liberación - ELN). Nevertheless, Mayimbú's group forced its rivals to draw back in sectors such as Timba, Buenos Aires and Jamundí, freeing itself of confrontations with the ELN.","Mayimbú was a considerable force within the ex-FARC Mafia, especially because he was able to point to more recent criminal feats after the demobilization, without needing to fall back on a significant track record within the FARC.Under Mayimbú, the Jaime Martínez Mobile Column was among the FARC dissidents that have prioritized criminal economies over any link to the FARC's political or social interests. Mayimbú was akin to leaders such as Walter Patricio Arizala, alias “Guacho,"" the former commander of the dissident Oliver Sinisterra Front who terrorized the department of Nariño up until his death in December 2018.Mayimbú was one of the winners of the criminal chess game in northern Cauca, but he also quickly becoming a high-value target for authorities. After his death, it remains uncertain who will take the reins of the dissidents in the area or if there is a real risk of fragmentation."
Álex Saab,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/alex-saab/,Álex Saab,,./images/individuals/álex-saab.jpg,2023-01-27,['venezuela personalities'],venezuela,"Álex Nain Saab Morán is a Colombian businessman and suspected international money launderer who is a close ally of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and who authorities say designed multi-million dollar schemes involving Venezuelan government officials. Saab has been a prisoner in the United States since 2021. He was extradited from Cabo Verde after his arrest in 2020 when his private jet landed in the West African nation to refuel.Saab is accused of being part of a corruption scheme that included kickbacks to Venezuelan government officials. According to the US Justice Department, Saab and his partner funneled more than $350 million to overseas accounts.","Álex Saab is the son of a Lebanese immigrant who settled in the city of Barranquilla and opened various businesses, finding success in Colombia's textile industry.Early in his career, he associated with Álvaro Pulido, a Colombian businessman who was involved in drug trafficking and who invited Saab to do business in Venezuela.Between 2004 and 2011, the two men exported merchandise to Australia, Ecuador, and Venezuela through a company called Shantex S.A. In Venezuela, their clients were small, relatively unknown businesses that had access to dollars at a preferential exchange rate thanks to the country's former currency control agency's (Comisión de Administración de Divisas -- CADIVI) official exchange system that became well-known for its serious corruption scandals.The close relationship between Saab and Chavismo dates back to 2011 when an agreement to supply the parts needed to build prefabricated houses for Venezuela's Housing Mission was signed in front of then-president Hugo Chávez, Chancellor Nicolás Maduro, and former Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos.The agreement was made with the company Fondo Global de Construcción (Foglocons), through which Saab and Pulido gained access to preferential exchange rates in Venezuela and to the Unified System for Regional Compensation (Sistema Unitario de Compensación Regional de Pagos -- Sucre), which Colombia and Ecuador advocated for.Between 2012 and 2013, the company received approximately $159 million to import housing kits into Venezuela. However, the company only delivered $3 million worth of products. Ecuador investigated the exports, suspecting money laundering, fictitious operations, and overbilling by Foglocons' affiliate in Ecuador. Although the case was eventually dismissed, Ecuadorian authorities have continued their investigations.Saab and Pulido started to participate in contracts in the food industry in 2015, when a newly created business partnership in Panama called Global Foods Trading, linked to the two businessmen via frontmen, signed at least four contracts worth around $125 million to supply corn, wheat, rice, and soy to Venezuela.From the end of 2016 onwards, with Group Grand Limited, Saab signed lucrative contracts to provide million food box combos for the Local Supply and Production Committees (Comités Locales de Abastecimiento y Producción -- CLAP) with the Táchira state government and Venezuela's Corporation of Foreign Trade (Corporación Venezolana de Comercio Exterior -- Corpovex).Although Saab seems to have maintained a low profile at first, the contractor's name started to gain notoriety in August 2017, when then-Venezuelan Attorney General Luisa Ortega Díaz named him as one of the men behind Group Grand Limited, along with Colombian businessmen Álvaro Pulido and Rodolfo Reyes. Attorney General Díaz indicated that the company really belonged to President Maduro.As part of this framework, they joined several other companies registered in the United Arab Emirates as intermediaries in the CLAP business. This occurred around the same time that the Maduro administration established a relationship with Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan with the purpose of refining gold extracted from the Orinoco Mining Arc, as well as for food conventions. A few months later, President Maduro officially created a mixed business between the state-owned Compañía General de Minería de Venezuela (CVG Minerven) and a company known as Marilyns Proje Yatirim, which is registered in Turkey. An investigation by the webpage Armando.Info linked the company in Turkey to Mulberry, another one of Saab's businesses. This serves as proof of Colombia's involvement in the Venezuelan gold business.In June 2020, Saab was arrested after his plane landed in Cabo Verde. The United States quickly filed an extradition request granted by Cabo Verde's Constitutional Court in September 2021.After this, Maduro, who had never mentioned Saab publicly, suspended negotiations with the opposition and launched an extensive campaign in his defense, alleging that he has diplomatic immunity and was on a humanitarian mission to Iran at the time of his arrest, although the legitimacy of this diplomatic condition is questionable.During the trial, it was revealed that in 2018, Saab became a collaborator of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), to which he transferred more than $10 million obtained through corruption. He also offered information on corruption within Maduro's government and agreed to turn himself into the US justice system on May 30, 2019, which he failed to comply with.","Álex Saab has been accused of money laundering in the United States. At the same time, in Colombia he was charged with a number of crimes, including money laundering, conspiracy, illicit enrichment, and aggravated fraud, among others. In Italy, he also faces money laundering and other charges.As businessmen, Saab and Pulido knit together a network of shady shell companies registered mainly in tax havens under third-party names, such as the names of their sons, siblings, and allies. Under the guise of these companies, Saab has allegedly undertaken fictitious exports and corrupt activities that have left him with hundreds of millions of dollars in profits. Journalistic investigations have proved the existence of price inflation in the invoices from Saab's contracts to provide food to the CLAP system and the poor quality and low nutritional values of the acquired products. Saab's foray into Venezuelan gold potentially demonstrates another side of his criminal portfolio. The participation of Venezuelan criminal groups, corrupt security officials, and Colombian guerrillas, such as the National Liberation Army (Ejército Nacional de Liberación — ELN) and ex-FARC Mafia, has been reported in the extraction of precious metals.","Álex Saab and his business partners' main operations have been focused in Venezuela, where they have had the support of the Maduro administration.For this, Saab has set up businesses in more than a dozen countries, including Brazil, China, Ecuador, Mexico, Hong Kong, India, Panama, the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, Italy, and Turkey, several of which are shell companies. Investigations from various countries have verified that the money received from the deals with Venezuela could be traced to banks in the United States, Panama, Malta, Spain, India, Israel, Italy, the United Kingdom, Russia, and beyond.At first, Saab and his associates used countries in the region like Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Panama as operational centers for his companies. In recent years, as his activities came under investigation, he moved his operations to Europe with the help of his Italian wife Camilla Fabri and her relatives.","The fact that Nicolás Maduro paid hundreds of millions of dollars to Saab, during the most serious economic crisis seen by the country, indicates that the relationship between the two is more than merely commercial.Álex Saab established relationships with key people in Colombia that helped him to access the highest levels of Maduro's government. One of his main connections has been the former Colombian senator Piedad Córdoba, who in various interviews, has commented about her relationship with the businessman from Barranquilla.","Maduro's efforts to free Saab have been significant, which may have been due to Saab's role as a frontman, or because of the information he might divulge about Venezuela's financial secrets to save himself.However, Saab's role as a supplier to the government appears to have been quickly filled by his partner Álvaro Pulido. The latter has continued and even increased deals with the Venezuelan government."

López Bello has denied the accusations but not his link to El Aissami.As of 2013, López Bello’s name started to appear publicly due to his supposed involvement in the purchase of Cadena Capriles, one of the oldest media outlets in Venezuela and the one with the largest audience reach. Following the publication’s purchase, its editorial line changed drastically in favor of the government.However,  López Bello’s relationship with the state through shady business practices dates back many years. His seemingly corrupt involvement has been found in projects related to construction, food supplies, the petroleum sector, and even the importing of Christmas trees.","The links between Samark López Bello and the Venezuelan government date back at least a decade.Between 2000 and 2008, the economist worked as director of planning and budgets in the Mérida state government during the administration of Florencio Porras. His contract ended on Porras' demand, who later said that López Bello had been involved in corruption.At this time, López Bello began a close friendship with Tareck El Aissami, when the latter was a top student leader at the Universidad de Los Andes.After leaving the government, and despite having been sued by the Bank of Venezuela in 2007 for owing the bank an important debt, López Bello entered the private sector. He would go on to own five companies in Venezuela: Profit Corporation, C. A., Alfa One, C. A., SMT Tecnología, Grupo Sahect, C. A, and Servicios Tecnológicos Industriales, C. A. He also signed contracts with the state-owned oil company, PDVSA (Petróleos de Venezuela) and the Ministry of the Interior and Justice (headed up by El Aissami between 2008 and 2012).However, it was not until 2013 that his name became well-known after allegations linked him to the purchase of Cadena Capriles. His involvement was called into question as the media company's editorial line began to favor the government. However, López Bello's role in the purchase has never been confirmed, and the identity of the owners of Cadena Capriles remains unknown.His rapid growth as a businessman resulted in him owning various holdings in the United States: MF Food Service, LLC, LH Industries Supplies INC and Sahect Holding LLC.In Panama, he owned the Yakima Trading Corp, created in February 2002, and of which he was named president in 2014. Yakima had various commercial ties to the Venezuelan government, including the sale of 5,712 pre-fabricated housing units to PDVSA.An investigation by news site Armando.info also connected him to Postar Intertrade Limited, which signed a contract in 2016 with Venezuela's Corporation of Foreign Trade (Corporación Venezolana de Comercio Exterior- Corpovex) to import Christmas trees. Later, Postar Intertrade would also agree to the sale of food boxes to Corpovex.But in February 2017, the United States pointed to López Bello as a frontman for El Aissami, who was accused of a range of crimes, including protecting drug traffickers and arranging shipments of drugs for unspecified cartels. ópez defended himself against accusations by the United States’ fiscal authority on his personal blog, alleging that his inclusion on the list was not justified, calling himself a legitimate businessman.Two years later, on March 8, 2019, the US government filed a new charge against El Aissami and López, this time for allegedly violating Washington’s 2017 sanctions by using private planes belonging to US companies to travel between Venezuela and Russia.On May 12, 2019, the Attorney General’s Specialized Anti-Asset Laundering Office in the Dominican Republic, accompanied by the country's National Drug Control Office (Dirección Nacional de Control de Drogas - DNCD) and US federal agents, raided two villas of a tourist complex in Verón, Punta Cana, which were reportedly owned by López Bello.Another investigation by Armando Info, following the leak of documents known as the Pandora Papers, linked López Bello to a Venezuelan bank called Bancamiga. This bank has seen enormous growth in the depressed Venezuelan banking sector since individuals linked to López Bello were named as shareholders and executives.Three US contractors, who were once kidnapped by the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - FARC) in 2003, and those entitled to compensation for what happened launched a court case in 2019 to keep assets seized from López. They alleged that the businessman maintained indirect links with the FARC through El Aissami, and won their case in 2020. However, the absence of evidence to prove an alleged relationship with the FARC led López to appealing. In 2022, the judicial order for his assets to be given to the contractors was overturned.","López has been linked to corruption crimes since his first foray into public administration.After his departure from the government of Mérida, then-governor, Florencio Porras, accused him of collecting bribes to favor certain infrastructure projects. But these accusations did not prevent him from entering the private sector and owning at least 13 domestic and international enterprises after the former governor removed him from his position. Through these holdings, López Bello managed to ensure important and murky contracts with the Venezuelan state.The most evident example of this link was the US accusation in 2017 that López Bello is the front man for Tareck El Aissami and that he has helped a Venezuelan narcotrafficking network embedded within the government, known as the Cartel of the Suns (Cartel de los Soles), to launder their profits.The US law enforcement statement points to López as “a key front man for El Aissami”, who launders El Aissami’s drug trafficking profits by purchasing assets and handling trade deals on his behalf.Both men face charges for violating sanctions imposed by the Department of the Treasury.","Samark López Bello’s corrupt business empire, made up of 13 companies, spanneded Venezuela, the United States, Panama, The British Virgin Islands, and the United Kingdom. He has also been indirectly linked to a business based in Barbados.The Dominican Republic, where López Bello maintained luxury properties, appears to have been one of his base of operations since authorities began going after him.","According to investigations, Samark López Bello’s greatest ally is the current Oil Minister, Tareck El Aissami. This friendship has assured that his corrupt business practices have endured for years. His business empire has diversified into construction, food, banking, oil and gas, and even Christmas tree imports, through companies related directly or indirectly to López Bello.Still, his criminal activities have been halted by the US justice system. By connecting him with narcotrafficking actions, the US government has confiscated his assets, frozen his accounts, and is now trying to track him down.","The disclosure of the criminal links between López Bello and Tareck El Aissami is an important step in stopping their illegal activities. US sanctions have prevented them from doing business with American companies and have stripped them of their assets abroad, limiting their range of action. On top of this, the constant surveillance they are now facing curtails continuing their corrupt business practices outside Venezuela.However, López Bello's business interests inside Venezuela seem sure to continue growing due to his close relations with the government.The inaction of the Venezuelan state in respect to El Aissami’s and López Bello's proven narcotrafficking activities demonstrate the complexities of this mafia state."
"Jarvis Chimenes Pavão, alias ""The Drug Kingpin""",https://insightcrime.org/paraguay-organized-crime-news/jarvis-chimenes-pavao-alias-the-drug-kingpin/,Jarvis Chimenes Pavão,"""The Drug Kingpin""",./images/individuals/jarvis-chimenes-pavão.jpg,2019-05-23,"['paraguay', 'paraguay personalities']",paraguay,"Brazilian national Jarvis Chimenes Pavão rose to become one of South America’s most prominent drug traffickers and the successor of a line of local capos along the strategic border between Paraguay and Brazil. His rise and fall mirror major shifts in the border’s underworld, which has witnessed the rise of the feared Brazilian PCC gang, and the fading away of old-school traffickers of the likes of Pavão.","Born in Brazil’s Ponta Porã border town across from Paraguay’s infamous Pedro Juan Caballero trafficking hotspot, Pavão began his criminal career in the 1990s. In 1994, the soon-to-become drug lord was arrested with 25 kilos of cocaine in a coastal city of Brazil’s Santa Catarina state, yet succeeded in avoiding conviction. As Brazil’s federal agents continued to build trafficking and money laundering evidence against Pavão, the suspect fled to Paraguay and continued his ascension within the drug underworld.Paraguayan authorities would finally catch up with Pavão in the Concepción border department in 2009. The Brazilian national was charged and condemned to eight years in prison for criminal association and money laundering, but not drug trafficking per se.Yet his capture did little to hamper his drug activities, as Pavão would long operate his drug empire from behind bars due to inexistent prison control and deep penitentiary corruption in Paraguay.After initial press reports in 2014, details of Pavão’s luxury life in Paraguay’s Tacumbú prison hit the headlines again in 2016 and scandal ensued. The incarcerated drug trafficker would later claim he funded for more than two billion guaranies (roughly $450,000 at the time) in repairs for the prison and even bought food for inmates, in exchange for a VIP treatment from the prison administration.Corruption was such that Pavão allegedly held drug business meetings with collaborators within Tacumbú. The two Brazilian convictions which Pavão would eventually be handed – one in absentia – both concern trafficking schemes ran from inside Paraguayan jails and distribution of narcotics across several Brazilian states.Under pressure from the scandal of Pavão’s VIP treatment and following the discovery of explosives in the walls of Tacumbú, Paraguayan authorities eventually transferred the drug trafficker to a penitentiary centre under police control (Agrupación Especializada) in July 2016. Images of the heavily militarized transfer detail extracting the drug lord out of Tacumbú spoke of authorities’ concern over Pavao’s potential capacity to mobilize men from behind bars.Yet once again, his incarceration did little to hamper the drug lord’s operations, and it was from inside the Agrupación Especializada in Asunción that Pavão is rumored to have made his most infamous move in the underworld: the spectacular hit on his competitor Jorge Rafaat Toumani, alias “Sadam.”Early one evening of June 2016, a pick-up truck at the back of which had been mounted a 50-millimeter anti-aerial gun, drove up in front of Rafaat’s bulletproof car, his two-vehicle escort, and blasted all three. Pavão’s competitor was riddled with 16 bullets, while the ensuing turf war shook Pedro Juan Caballero – the crown jewel for the region’s drug lords – for hours.The killing, carried out with men from Pavão’s then-ally the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC), completely reshuffled the deck within the border underworld and signalled the advent of the Brazilian PCC gang rule in that key trafficking corridor.The drug lord was finally extradited in December 2017 and under impressive security measures to Brazil. Upon his extradition, a Paraguayan prison intelligence officer told El País:“The border used to be dominated by old-school capos who worked as small companies. I see Pavão as an intermediary. He’s neither in nor out. He’s in the middle. He’s of the old-school type of drug traffickers who don’t want trouble. They don’t want blood, they want tranquillity, nothing more. So he’s good with the state and he’s good with the criminals.”In addition to a 2014 conviction in absentia, a Brazil court sentenced the drug lord to more than 13 years in jail in 2018 for a second drug trafficking scheme ran during his incarceration in Paraguay.","Early in the 1990s and while still operating from Brazil, Pavão was allegedly a “large-scale distributor” for certain cities of the Santa Catarina state.After fleeing to Paraguay and initially under the auspices of Fahd Jamil Georges, the so-called “King of the Border” who for years called the shots along the Paraguay-Brazil border, Pavão gradually extended his control of trafficking routes to smuggle Paraguayan marijuana, as well as Colombian and Bolivian cocaine to his home country.Authorities claim that among Pavão’s providers were the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC), to whom he allegedly exchanged weapons for cocaine. The kingpin always denied the claim, however.As the organization grew, Pavão acquired small airplanes to run his drug flights across Bolivia, Paraguay and Brazil, and began moving drugs as far into Brazil as the states of Minas Gerais and São Paulo.","Although arrested in Paraguay’s Concepción department, Pavão is thought to have used Pedro Juan Caballero, Amambay, as the center of operations for his trafficking organization. In addition to Paraguay, his contacts extended to Bolivia and Colombia from where he acquired cocaine, and his organization moved the drugs to several Brazilian states including Santa Catarino, Mato Grosso do Sul, Minas Gerais and São Paulo.","Though Pavão claims the two drug businessmen enjoyed amicable relations, authorities suspected Pavao of ordering the spectacular hit on Rafaat, carried out by the PCC in Pedro Juan Caballero.The alliance between the incarcerated drug trafficker and the Brazilian gang lasted for some time. In October 2017, Brazil even warned Paraguay that communications intercepts suggested the PCC was planning on busting Pavão free. This alliance appears to have broken down since, however.","Pavão is now held in a maximum security prison in northeast Brazil, which appears to have significantly damaged his ability to manage his drug operations. His criminal career appears heavily jeopardized.Cut off from the outside world, Pavão suffered a second blow to his business with the apparent rupture of his alliance with the PCC. The Brazilian gang is reportedly picking off Pavão’s remaining men in the border one by one, and just between November 2018 and January 2019 was blamed for the attempted or successful murders of two of Pavão’s nephews, his uncle, his lawyer and asset manager, as well as the individual suspected of coordinating Pavão’s drug flights. The PCC’s frontal confrontation of the state and rival criminals appears to ratify the fall of the old-school trafficker that many have come to describe as the “last border kingpin.”"
Tareck El Aissami,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/tareck-el-aissami/,Tareck El Aissami,,./images/individuals/tareck-el-aissami.jpg,2019-06-17,['venezuela personalities'],venezuela,"Tareck El Aissami is the Minister of Industries and National Production of Venezuela. He has held this position since June 2018, the latest in a series of high-ranking positions in the cabinets of the late former President Hugo Chávez and his successor, President Nicolás Maduro. He was previously executive vice president, a position where he was proven to have links with organized crime.In February 2017, the US Treasury Department charged El Aissami with drug trafficking. This saw his visa revoked, his assets in the United States confiscated and a ban placed on all US institutions from having financial or commercial dealings with him.He is also accused of helping members from the Hezbollah terrorist group enter Venezuela, according to investigations by the Venezuelan intelligence service revealed by the New York Times.This accusation was first made by drug trafficker Walid Makled, and was confirmed in February 2019 by Major General Hugo Carvajal Barrios, Venezuela's former intelligence chief, who accused El Aissami of having established links with the Lebanese Shiite militant organization since 2009.None of these charges has limited his time in government.","Tareck El Aissami studied law and criminology at the University of Los Andes (ULA), where he founded the Utopía 78 Student Movement. While being a student leader within ULA, he met Adán Chávez, the brother of former President Chávez. He joined the Fifth Republic Movement and became the national youth director of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela in 1997.After obtaining his law degree, El Aissami entered public service and in 2003, he became the first head of Mission Identidad, a program to oversee national identity cards in the country.In 2005, he participated in parliamentary elections and won a seat in the state of Mérida, with 97 percent of the vote. Two years later, in January 2007, he was named deputy minister of prevention and citizen security.El Aissami's rise continued when he was named interior and justice minister in September 2008 after the resignation of Ramón Rodríguez Chacín. He remained in this position until December 2012, when he won the governorship of the state of Aragua. During his time there, he made modifications to the prison system, which led to the emergence of new powerful figure inside Venezuela prisons: gang leaders known as ""pranes.""El Aissami's ties to organized crime began to be evident in 2010, when Venezuelan drug trafficker Walid Makled claimed that a brother of El Aissami had helped him carry out illegal activities and that the minister had been aware of the situation. Makled also said that the government had facilitated the entry of Hezbollah into Venezuela, with El Aissami being in charge of this relationship.These accusations have done nothing to slow El Aissami's ascendancy. He was named executive vice president by Nicolás Maduro in January 2017.On February 13, 2017, the US Treasury Department accused El Aissami of drug trafficking, revoked his visa, confiscated his assets in the United States and banned US companies or individuals from having any financial or business dealings with him. However, Maduro defended him and kept him in office until June 2018, when he was appointed minister of industries and national production.On March 8, 2019, the US government again charged El Aissami, and an associate, Samark López Bello, with violating the sanctions imposed by Washington two years previously. The US Justice Department said the two men had evaded the sanctions, traveling between Venezuela and Russia to carry out illicit business dealings on private planes provided by companies based in the United States.","Tareck El Aissami's links to organized crime stretch back years, and clear increases in violence can be traced to decisions he has taken while holding high political office.After the United States imposed sanctions on him in 2017, a US government official linked him to drug trafficking, terrorism, money laundering and gold smuggling, among other criminal economies.As minister of interior and justice, a position he held between 2008 and 2012, the government softened control over prisons, giving more freedom to gangs and essentially handing over control of prisons to a new form of gang boss: the pranes.According to information documented by the Venezuelan Observatory of Prisons, Tareck El Aissami relaxed rules for visiting prisons, leading to an increase in contraband and smuggling.This fostered the spread of illegal economies within prisons. The pranes began charging taxes (of up to 10 times the market price) for any items entering their prison. Food shops, hairdressers and other commerces which did business inside the prison walls began paying these taxes. Families of prisoners and sex workers could enter with greater freedom and drugs and alcohol circulated freely. These criminal gangs then began using the prisons as safe havens, but left to carry out their activities, leading to a rise in violence.A 2011 riot at the El Rodeo prison in the state of Miranda revealed new evidence about the mafia-like structures which El Aissami had allowed to thrive during his time as minister of interior and justice. In order to keep this quiet, the government created a new ministry for prison affairs, but it seems the initial minister, Iris Varela, continued to work with the prison gangs instead of combating them.As interior and justice minister, El Aissami created the Bolivarian National Police, which stripped power from local security agencies at the municipal and state level, especially in opposition-held areas. However, crime has only increased in Caracas and other major cities since then. During his term as governor of Aragua, beginning in 2012, violence in the state worsened and it now stands as one of the most unsafe places in Venezuela.El Aissami's time as minister of the interior and justice also saw a sharp rise in ""megabandas,"" criminal gangs of over 50 individuals, dedicated to kidnapping, extortion, vehicle theft, microtrafficking of drugs and other crimes.Declarations by drug trafficker Walid Makled in 2010, corroborated by Brazilian magazine Veja in March 2015 as well as by the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), point to El Aissami having been the link between the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia -- FARC) and Hezbollah. A witness told Veja in 2013 that 35 Hezbollah members had stayed in Venezuela and been provided with Venezuelan passports by El Aissami.In 2017, the US Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) stated that El Aissami had facilitated drug trafficking operations and protected other drug traffickers operating in Venezuela. According to OFAC, he had received payments from Makled for helping to coordinate drug shipments. The US report also stated that El Aissami has had links to the Zetas Mexican drug cartel, and had also provided protection to Colombian drug trafficker Daniel Barrera Barrera and Venezuelan capo Hermágoras González Polanco, as well as having been involved in the transportation of over 1,000 kilograms of narcotics.However, El Aissami has not only been investigated by the US government. The New York Times claimed in May 2019 that the Venezuelan intelligence agency itself had investigated the minister's illegal business dealings, allegedly confirming his links with Hezbollah, Makled and drug trafficking.","According to the US Treasury Department, El Aissami is involved in shipping drugs from Venezuela to Mexico and the United States, both by air and sea.His supposed links to terrorism have a greater geographical scope. Since 2009, according to former military intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal, El Aissami made visits to Syria to further connections with Hezbollah, while he issued Venezuelan passports to some of the group's members.","The drug trafficking networks facilitated by Tareck El Aissami have helped him forge relationships with several of the world's most dangerous criminal groups, including the Zetas in Mexico and Colombia's now extinct FARC guerrilla group.His time in public office has seen him tolerate or encourage the increase in power of criminal groups, such as the pranes. These links to organized crime have been possible thanks to mafia structure within the Venezuelan state.","Although his criminal ties first arose in 2010, El Aissami's continuing importance in Venezuelan politics means the United States will continue to see him as a major target for investigations. Sanctions issued by the Treasury Department against El Aissami and his associate, Samark López Bello, appear to have somewhat diminished his capacity to act and trade in illegal goods.But the influence of El Aissami's criminal structure continues to have wide-ranging influence in Venezuela and the region. The influence of El Aissami's criminal networks and the increase of criminal structures in the region keep on alert the international organizations responsible for the fight against drug trafficking and terrorism, so that measures to close their businesses and their allies could continue with the objective of diminishing its power until it is nullified."
"Seuxis Pausías Hernández, alias 'Jesús Santrich'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/seuxis-pausias-hernandez-alias-jesus-santrich/,Seuxis Pausías Hernández,Jesús Santrich,./images/individuals/seuxis-pausías-hernández.jpg,2021-05-18,"['colombia personalities', 'ex-farc mafia', 'farc', 'farc peace']",colombia,"Seuxis Pausías Hernández Solarte, alias “Jesús Santrich,” was a senior former FARC commander who participated in that guerrilla group's demobilization process before taking up arms again in 2019 to form a new dissident force known as the Segunda Marquetalia. He was killed in May 2021 in Venezuela in uncertain circumstances.Santrich was one of the most important delegates for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) at their peace talks with the Colombian government, and he was involved in the drafting of the final peace agreement signed in 2016. Though he was granted a seat in Colombia’s congress as part of the agreement, he could not be sworn in because he faced charges for his alleged involvement in sending a drug shipment to the United States. This led to him being arrested and released from jail twice, until he ultimately fled from a FARC reintegration camp in July 2019.Santrich then appeared to be based along the remote Venezuela-Colombia border, with other dissident FARC leaders. An influential voice among the guerrillas, he seemed to be a key negotiator for the new Segunda Marquetalia when it came to brokering ties with other former FARC groups, other armed factions and Venezuelan authorities.It was reported on May 18, 2021 that Santrich had been killed in clashes in Venezuela","Seuxis Pausías Hernández Solarte was born in 1966 in Toluviejo, in the department of Sucre, where his parents were teachers. During his student years, he joined the Colombia Communist Youth (Juventud Comunista de Colombia – JUCO) and then became a militant member of the Patriotic Union (Unión Patriótica – UP), a recognized left-wing party. After graduation, he became a local official in Sucre's municipality of Colosó,In 1991, he joined the FARC after one of his colleagues was killed by members of the former Administrative Department of Security (Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad – DAS). His alias within the guerrilla group was taken as tribute to his friend, Jesús Santrich. His role in the creation of Resistance Radio (Radio Resistencia) and his friendship with Luciano Marin Arango, alias “Iván Márquez,” saw him quickly gain importance within the FARC. He became a key figure within the 19th Front of the FARC’s Caribbean Bloc, despite suffering from Leber’s Disease, a degeneration of the eye which has left him nearly blind.One of his most important tasks was to help lead the FARC’s communications and propaganda efforts through a clandestine network of broadcasts, such as Cadena Radial Bolivariana and Voz de la Resistencia. It is believed that the website, resistencia-colombia.org, which featured exclusive content from the FARC, was also run by Santrich.He also took part in the peace process with the government of President Andrés Pastrana (1998-2002).Santrich, who lived along the border with Venezuela, played a key role in the FARC’s relationship with Caracas, as Santrich is known to have been an avid believer in former Venezuelan president Hugo Chávez and his Bolivarian Revolution. In 2007, he and Márquez met with Chávez in Venezuela to discuss a humanitarian agreement.In 2008, he joined the FARC’s General Staff. When peace talks began between the FARC and the administration of President Juan Manuel Santos in 2012, he became one of the FARC’s main negotiators.After the signing of the final peace agreement, Santrich became one of the three FARC representatives in the Monitoring and Implementation Commission of the Agreement (CSIVI), overseeing the peace process. He was also set to be one of the 10 FARC representatives in Congress in July 2018.But his entry into Congress was blocked after his indictment by US federal prosecutors on drug charges. The April 2018 arrest of Santrich and the demand by the US Department of Justice (DOJ) for his extradition set off a legal firestorm since FARC members -- under the peace agreement -- cannot be extradited for crimes committed prior to December 1, 2016. The Attorney General’s Office wanted him extradited, but Colombia’s peace court, the Colombian Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz – JEP), asked for more evidence about his alleged crimes and their timeframe.In May 2019, about a year after Santrich’s arrest, the JEP’s judges blocked the extradition of Santrich because they could not confirm, based on the evidence given to them, whether Santrich broke the terms of the peace agreement. Santrich was released from prison, but the Colombian prosecutors had him immediately rearrested, saying they had new evidence against him. Santrich was then released again, this time by the Supreme Court, because he was still considered to have immunity as a member of congress, though he had not been seated.He moved to a designated Territorial Space for Training and Reincorporation (Espacio Territorial de Capacitación y Reincorporación – ETCR) in the northern Cesar department, along the Venezuela border. He did not stay for long. With the help of a comrade, Santrich climbed through his housing’s window, and then he fled across the border into Venezuela.After the formation of the Segunda Marquetalia, he appeared to mostly be based between Apure, Venezuela and Arauca, Colombia before his death in May 2021.","During his time with the FARC, Santrich was one of the main leaders of the Caribbean Bloc. Due to his degenerative illness leaving him blind, he became known as a spokesperson, focusing on ideology and propaganda, rather than on military action. Two years after signing the peace agreement, he was accused of sending 10 tons of cocaine to the United States.The drug smuggling operation allegedly happened between June 2017 and April 2018, and involved Mexico’s powerful Sinaloa Cartel. It appears that the charges against him stem from a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operation in which Marlon Marín -- the nephew of Iván Márquez -- was observed retrieving $5 million from a DEA informant acting as an emissary for the cartel.","Hernández joined the Caribbean Block of the FARC, specifically the 19th Front that operated in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The group also had influence in the region of the Montes de María, the Serrania de Perijá and the departments of Sucre and Córdoba. By consolidating himself as an important member of the General Staff, he was able to expand his influence to other regions such as Nariño, Putumayo, Guainía and Caquetá and establish contact with important leaders of criminal groups such as the dissidence of the FARC and the Urabeños.After the formation of the Segunda Marquetalia, he appeared to mostly be based between Apure, Venezuela and Arauca, Colombia before his death in May 2021.","Hernández was known to have been close to Juvenal Ovidio Ricardo Palmera, alias ""Simón Trinidad,"" who was extradited to the United States in 2004. He also maintained a strong friendship with Luciano Marín Arango, alias “Iván Márquez,” another former top FARC commander, member of the General Staff and former leader of the Caribbean Bloc.Outside of former FARC leaders, Santrich maintained contact with other dissident FARC groups, including those led by Miguel Botache Santillana, alias “Gentil Duarte” and Géner García Molina, alias “Jhon 40.” He was also suspected of having direct contact with Rafael Caro Quintero, alias “Don Rafa,” one of the founders of the now-defunct Guadalajara Cartel and once an important member of the Sinaloa Cartel.Santrich was also a major target of the US government, which offered a $10 million reward for his capture, as well as Iván Márquez, in June 2020 due to their alleged connections to the Venezuelan government.","Despite initially accepting to demobilize and being part of the FARC's negotiation team, Santrich abandoned the peace process in July 2019 and formed the Segunda Marquetalia that August, alongside Iván Márquez.The Colombian government issued a colossal reward for his capture but it appears Santrich moved to Venezuela shortly after. He remained at large for two years until his death in May 2021. Different versions of his death suggested he may have been killed by Colombian troops, Venezuelan armed forces or by rival dissident FARC factions."

In 2018, he fled a reintegration camp in Caquetá, where he was staying along with other ex-combatants.El Paisa was not seen again until August 2019, when he appeared in the video alongside guerrilla commander Luciano Marín, alias “Iván Márquez,” that announced their return to war.In December 2021, Venezuelan and Colombian media reported that El Paisa was killed in Venezuela's western department of Apure, alongside one of his closest allies, Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias “Romaña."" This news was later confirmed by Colombia's Defense Minister.","A native of Remedios, Antioquia, El Paisa was raised in Medellín, where some say he came under the tutelage of Pablo Escobar and the Medellín Cartel, acting as a “sicario,” or contract killer,” while also learning about arms and drugs trafficking.At just 19 years old, he had a number of warrants out for his arrest, and he partnered with the FARC, because he thought the guerrillas would provide him with protection. He was imprisoned in 1989 after he was caught in Jamaica conducting an arms trafficking deal to trade cocaine for 1,000 rifles and 250 mortars. Upon his release, he joined up with the FARC’s Eastern Bloc, led by Victor Julio Suarez, alias “Mono Jojoy.” El Paisa terrorized the department of Antioquia, placing checkpoints on roads and demanding drivers pay a tax to let their vehicles pass.In 1993, he was placed in command of the newly created Teófilo Forero Mobile Column. Known as “La Teófilo,” the elite group of fighters was created to protect the FARC’s top leadership, known collectively as the Secretariat.The late FARC leader Mono Jojoy, then the commander of the Eastern Bloc, took an interest in El Paisa, who had a penchant for violence and brought a number of skills from his time with the Medellín Cartel, including urban warfare tactics.As dialogue began between the FARC and the government of President Andrés Pastrana in 1998, the Teófilo column focused its sphere of influence and action in the southwest department of Huila.El Paisa’s stature within the FARC grew as the rebel force built its military capacity, especially in the Eastern and Southern Blocs. The Eastern Bloc was headed by Mono Jojoy, while El Paisa served in the Southern Bloc, where he handpicked the men serving under him.El Paisa led some of the bloodiest actions perpetrated by the FARC during this chapter of the Colombian conflict, starting with the murder of Diego Turbay Cote and his family in 2000 and the infamous takeover of the Miraflores building in 2001, which marked the first massive kidnapping.In 2002, he effectively ended peace talks with former President Pastrana when his Teófilo unit hijacked a commercial aircraft carrying political opponent Jorge Gechem. This was followed by the car bombing of Club El Nogal in Bogotá in 2003 and the kidnapping of 12 deputies from Valle del Cauca in 2007.After the deaths of FARC leaders Mono Jojoy and Guillermo Leon Saenz, alias “Alfonso Cano,” in 2010 and 2011 respectively, the FARC needed to regroup and restructure. It did so through what was called Plan Renacer, or “Rebirth Plan,” which counted on El Paisa and his Teófilo Column, now the guerrilla’s special forces unit.By 2013, El Paisa and the Teófilo column had inflicted such damage that the government founded the Jupiter Task Force, a unit devoted exclusively to combatting him and his fighters.As the first overtures between the government of President Juan Manuel Santos and the FARC were made, El Paisa was named to the FARC’s General Staff. El Paisa made his reservations about the negotiations known. Yet in April 2016, he joined the FARC peace delegation in Havana, denying he was opposed to the peace process.At the signing and implementation of the peace agreement, El Paisa was put in charge of the Territorial ​​Training and Reincorporation Space (ETCR) of Miravalle in Caquetá. In 2018, he was joined there by Márquez, who had refused his senate seat in Bogotá after the arrest of former commander Seuxis Pausías Hernández Solarte, alias “Jesús Santrich,” on drug charges. Around April 2018, El Paisa fled the ETCR for Venezuela.El Paisa’s disappearance was a blow to the already fraught peace process, as he was considered crucial to learning the truth of what happened during decades of conflict.He was repeatedly asked to return to the peace process. His failure to do so led the government to issue a warrant for his arrest in April 2019.He appeared in a video on August 29, 2019, alongside Luciano Marín Arango, alias ""Iván Márquez,"" Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias “Romaña,” and Seuxis Pausias Hernández, alias ""Jesús Santrich,"" announcing their return to arms.By December 2021, the progress of the Second Marquetalia has stalled in its tracks. Santrich, El Paisa and Romaña are all dead, depriving the group of much of its leadership and its legacy.","El Paisa provided the manpower behind the FARC’s cocaine business, protecting coca crops and providing security for drug shipments. However, regular confrontations with Colombian security forces made it increasingly difficult for his Teófilo Forero Mobile Column to stay under the radar.His unit also counted on resources from extortion and kidnapping, which eventually became their main sources of income. In areas under its control, the Teófilo column maintained a system of taxes on farms and passing vehicles. For several years, El Paisa managed to collect up to 2 billion pesos ($615,000) in this way.","During his time in the guerrilla, El Paisa settled in the territory that runs from Caquetá to Huila, along the Eastern Cordillera of the Andes. His zone of control stretched across the municipalities of San Vicente del Caguán, Puerto Rico, Algeciras, Campoalegre, Neiva, La Uribe, Baraya, Colombia, Mesetas and San Juan de Arama.During the peace process, he was back in familiar territory, at the Miravelle ETCR in San Vicente del Caguán, until his escape from the reintegration camp. Then, as part of the Second Marquetalia, he likely moved between Venezuela and Arauca in Colombia, backed by a strong security force.","During his time in the guerrilla, Velásquez established close ties with Mono Jojoy, commander of the FARC’s Eastern Bloc. He also allied himself with Manuel Marulanda, alias “Tirofijo,” the guerrilla group’s head of security.El Paisa and his Teófiló Forero column were under constant pursuit by a special police unit called “Los Lobos,” or “The Wolves,” and the Jupiter Unit.  But he eluded them, always moving with a dozen bodyguards and employing a ring of 80 fighters who stayed on alert for any movement by armed forces.Iván Márquez became his closest ally when the two men chose to form the Second Marquetalia. He was also close to Romaña and Jesús Santrich, before all three men perished in 2021.","In the August 2019 video where Marquez calls on demobilized FARC guerrillas to return to war, El Paisa stood beside him, in camouflage and holding an M4 rifle. Like the other former FARC leaders in the video, a 3 billion-peso bounty (about $885,000) was offered for any information leading to his arrest.Thanks to his experience as the head of the Teófilo column, El Paisa provided unmatched military prowess and leadership.He may have been able to bring many former fighters into the Second Marquetalia and would have been an asset to reunify the FARC, given his deep knowledge of drug trafficking operations and cocaine production.But his death, alongside that of Romaña, and coming on the heels of the killing of Jesús Santrich, may well mark the beginning of the end for the Second Marquetalia."
"Walter Patricio Arizala, alias “Guacho”",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/walter-patricio-arizala-alias-guacho/,Walter Patricio Arizala,“Guacho”,./images/individuals/walter-patricio-arizala.jpg,2019-01-18,"['colombia', 'colombia mafia', 'colombia personalities', 'ex-farc mafia']",colombia,"Walter Patricio Arizala, alias “Guacho,” was one of the most wanted criminals in both Colombia and Ecuador, after military forces made him a priority target. Guacho led a group of dissident members from the now largely demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) known as the Oliver Sinisterra Front. The dissident front is alleged to have been behind the deaths of three Ecuadorean journalists and the massacre of eight coca farmers in the Colombian department of Nariño, located on the border with Ecuador.While the Oliver Sinisterra Front may define itself as an active FARC guerrilla group, its criminal structure can be better described as ex-FARC Mafia, controlling drug trafficking in one of Colombia’s most successful coca producing territories.","Guacho was born on November 9, 1989, in Ecuador's Esmeraldas province along the border with Colombia. He ran a small business before joining the FARC and engaging in a decade of combat with the group.The FARC’s Daniel Aldana Mobile Column (CMDA), which operated on the Pacific coast of Nariño department, recruited Guacho in 2007. Its activities took place along the upper and lower Mira River, where the greatest number of Colombia’s illicit crops are concentrated.In the FARC, Guacho served as a community organizer, financial chief and explosives expert. He was a favorite of CMDA commander Gustavo González Sánchez, alias “Rambo,” who already had 30 years of guerrilla experience. Under Rambo’s mentorship, Guacho learned much of what was required to be involved in both war and the drug business.In 2016, the FARC signed a peace agreement with the Colombian government and demobilized. Guacho took part in this process, moving to an outlying village in Tumaco, a port city on the Pacific coast. He spent four months there in a local transitional zone for normalization, which helps demobilized FARC members reintegrate into society. However, he decided to leave because he believed only top guerrilla leaders would benefit from the peace agreement.Thus, Guacho created the dissident Oliver Sinisterra Front, named in honor of the third in command of the CMDA, which by then had disbanded. The front started out with 250 armed members, adding to an already existing collection of militias in the area. Colombia's Attorney General’s Office has said that the group currently numbers over 300, and the Ideas for Peace Foundation (Fundación Ideas para la Paz – FIP) think tank has reported that there are 500 current members. The weapons they carry include Colt AR-15 and M16 rifles, M-4 carbines with grenade launchers and Pietro Beretta pistols, which are believed to come from Central America and Ecuador.“We are not dissidents; we are still active guerrillas,” Guacho has said. While there is no evidence of activity resembling an insurgent struggle, since rearming, the Oliver Sinisterra Front has managed to seize control of the old routes, illicit crop farms, laboratory networks and transnational contacts that the CMDA used for trafficking drugs.This enabled the group to gain control of drug trafficking routes exiting Colombia from the south towards Central America and southern Latin America. It is also suspected that the front uses the port city of San Lorenzo in Ecuador’s northern coastal province of Esmeraldas as a transit point and logistical center. Guacho allegedly orchestrated a 2018 car bombing attack on the city’s police station, an indication of the importance the region holds for the dissidents.Eventually, the Oliver Sinisterra Front became the main cocaine supplier to the Sinaloa Cartel, conducting operations that amounted to as much as $25 million per week.But government pressure increased on the group as well. In response to persistent criminal acts occurring along Colombia’s Pacific coast, former Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos launched the Atlas military operation in 2017 with 9,000 soldiers and police to attack every link in the group's drug trafficking activities and their connections.In September 2018, recently inaugurated Colombian President Iván Duque stated that Operation Anguila, which was carried out in a coastal region of Nariño department called the Telembí Triangle, may have left Guacho wounded. However, that information could not be confirmed by then-commander of the Colombian military, General Alberto José Mejía.The Oliver Sinisterra Front took a series of blows with the declaration of Guacho as a primary target, disputes for control over drug trafficking routes with other criminal groups such as the United Guerrillas of the Pacific (Guerrillas Unidas del Pacífico – GUP), and the loss of various drug shipments. The dissident leader was left spending his last days isolated and in hiding on an indigenous reservation in the village of Llorente within the municipality of Tumaco.Finally, on December 21, 2018, the leader of the Oliver Sinisterra Front was killed in a joint operation between Colombian military forces, the National Police and the Attorney General’s Office.It is believed that Guacho lost 40 percent of his men to arrests and killings during security force operations. Additionally, 130 of his laboratories were destroyed, two of which were underground. He also lost a semi-submersible submarine belonging to the Sinaloa Cartel, and authorities seized more than 50 tons of cocaine from his organization.","Guacho spent 10 years committing crimes with the CMDA, a structure that victimized a large part of Nariño department’s population through homicides, displacements, landmines, illegal taxes and drug crop and laboratory seizures. Its military and financial prowess led the public to see the CMDA as one of the most feared FARC guerrilla units in Colombia.As a member of the former guerrilla movement, Guacho underwent special forces training abroad, which gave him experience in handling explosives and later set him up to coordinate several attacks against security forces in the south of Colombia.. By 2012, he was squadron head and finance commander of the CMDA, according to authorities.After joining the FARC dissidence, Guacho decided to take control of the border territory with Ecuador, which gave him access to hundreds of farms producing illicit crops as well as drug laboratories. It also gave him his start in the international market.With every expansion into rural towns and indigenous reservations, he also victimized an increasing number of local populations. Several area residents told InSight Crime that by 2017, the Oliver Sinisterra Front had already recruited many of the region’s children and teenagers.Unlike its predecessors, the actions of Guacho’s group had little to do with a subversive struggle in defense of political ideals; they were instead based on protecting drug trafficking territory. As such, the Oliver Sinisterra Front’s violent actions have been aimed at hindering the security forces’ counternarcotics operations and undermining the Colombian government’s illicit crop eradication and substitution programs agreed upon as part of the FARC's peace deal.In April 2017, Guacho was identified as the primary suspect in the 24-hour kidnapping of 12 policemen who, along with 43 other officers, participated in an aggressive coca eradication operation in Llorente, known for its high rates of drug trafficking.Guacho was also considered to be responsible for a massacre that took place in the hamlet of Puerto Rico, a rural area also within the Tumaco municipality. Six people were killed and 52 were injured in the confrontation between the Oliver Sinisterra Front and security forces, the point of contention being the use of forced eradication to combat illicit crops instead of substitution.On the Ecuadorean side of the border, Guacho’s group has been accused of crimes such as forced recruitment and carrying out a car bomb attack against the San Lorenzo Police Station in Esmeraldas province, which injured 28 people.But two other incidents earned Guacho and the Oliver Sinisterra Front most of their international notoriety. One was the kidnapping and murder of three Ecuadorean press workers. The other was the murder of an Ecuadorean couple.","Guacho’s criminal life with the CMDA was centered around Tumaco in Colombia and certain border areas in Ecuador’s Esmeraldas province.As leader of the Oliver Sinisterra Front in the ex-FARC mafia structure, he continued to dominate the Colombia-Ecuador border, especially along the Mira and Mataje rivers in the village of Llorente and the hamlets of El Azúcar, Vallenato, Los Cocos, El Playó, La Corozala, La Aduana and Yarumala. Guacho also attempted to expand into other municipalities besides Tumaco, such as Roberto Payán, also on Colombia’s Pacific coast in Nariño department. In Ecuador, he and his criminal group operated in San Lorenzo, in Esmeraldas province.","Among Guacho’s allies, the Sinaloa Cartel bears mentioning as it has been the Oliver Sinisterra Front’s main international commercial partner. Miguel Botache Santillana, alias “Gentil Duarte,” commander of the 1st Front FARC dissident group, was also an ally.In contrast, Guacho had significantly more enemies. Both Ecuadorean and Colombian security forces focused much of their military might on the border to neutralize Guacho and his men. The main criminal groups that fought Guacho over territory and control of the region’s drug trafficking included the GUP and a smaller drug trafficking group called Renacer (Rebirth).Other possible rivals, by virtue of the fact that their territory may overlap with that of the Oliver Sinisterra Front, include the Gulf Clan, Los Negritos, El Nuevo Grupo, La Empresa, La Gente del Orden and the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN).","Although at the time of his death Guacho still controlled the drug trafficking routes and illicit crop farms operating between Tumaco and Esmeraldas, it is clear that the state's response to his criminal activity had diminished his military capacity, freedom of movement and finances.Guacho’s exit from the criminal landscape represents a risk for the Oliver Sinisterra Front because other criminal organizations likely see his death as an opportunity to seize control of the group’s strategic territory and take over the drug trafficking connections Guacho established with the Sinaloa Cartel.However, this is no indication of a future reduction in the drug trafficking business. On the contrary, neutralizing Guacho will translate into less pressure on the Colombian government to continue showing results for its efforts against an activity that currently produces the country’s highest economic returns."
"Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho, alias ‘Marcola’",https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/marcos-willians-herbas-camacho-marcola/,Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho,Marcola,./images/individuals/marcos-willians-herbas-camacho.jpg,2022-07-18,"['brazil', 'brazil personalities', 'pcc']",brazil,"Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho, known by the aliases “Marcola” and “Playboy,” has been the top leader of Brazil’s biggest and most powerful criminal organization, the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), since 2002. Marcola built notoriety in São Paulo’s underworld in the late 1990s through a series of bank robberies, before working his way up the ranks of the PCC. Although Marcola has spent the majority of his life in prison, he is thought to have run the PCC’s criminal operations from behind bars since the early 2000s.","Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho was born in São Paulo to a Bolivian father and Brazilian mother in 1968. Orphaned at nine, he began wandering the streets of the sprawling metropolis as a petty thief. Around this time, he earned his lifelong alias “Marcola” -- a combination of his first name and the word “cola,” the Brazilian slang for a potent industrial glue that he often inhaled. Marcola’s criminal activities escalated from petty theft to more serious robberies, until he was arrested for the first time in 1986, for robbing a bank.After his arrest, Marcola began serving time in the overpopulated and prisoner-controlled Carandiru prison in the city of São Paulo. In 1992, security forces massacred more than 100 inmates in Carandiru, setting the scene for the emergence of the PCC. The year after the Carandiru massacre, Marcola was transferred to another prison called Taubaté, in the interior of the state of São Paulo. By the time he arrived, a group of inmates -- including PCC co-founders José Márcio Felício, alias “Geleião,” and Marcola’s childhood friend Dionísio César Leite, alias “Cesinha” -- were beginning to form a prisoner rights group. Marcola stayed somewhat on the fringes of the group but was eventually baptized into what was then called the Crime Party (“Partido do Crime”).Marcola was later transferred back to Carandiru, and he began to command increased respect among the inmates. He was also able to escape the prison several times to continue his criminal activities. As a fugitive, Marcola lived the majority of the time in Paraguay but often planned and executed large-scale robberies of banks and armored vehicles in São Paulo. By the late 1990s, he had developed a reputation as a notorious bank robber, earning the second alias “Playboy” because of his taste for fancy cars, expensive watches and designer clothes.Marcola was already well established in São Paulo’s underworld when he decided it would be beneficial for him to officially join the Taubaté prisoner gang that had evolved into a criminal organization called the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC). Marcola, who is often described as a ""devourer of books"" and an ""intellectual,"" quickly moved up the ranks and became next-in-command to PCC co-founders Cesinha and Geleião.In July 1999, the PCC carried out the biggest bank heist in São Paulo’s history, stealing more than 32 million Brazilian reais. Later that month, police in São Paulo spotted Marcola driving around in one of his imported luxury cars and arrested him. He has been in prison ever since.Marcola was sentenced to 232 years and 11 months in maximum-security prison for robbery, drug trafficking, homicide and forming a criminal group. He began serving his prison sentence in the early 2000s. According to the book ""Blood Ties: The PCC’s Secret History"" (""Laços de Sangue: A História Secreta do PCC""), he may have served as a police informant, using his lawyer and ex-wife Ana Maria Olivatto to pass information to authorities including cell phone numbers used by imprisoned PCC leaders Cesinha and Geleião. Based on authorities’ recordings of conversations on these phone lines, both PCC leaders were moved into isolation at São Paulo's maximum-security Presidente Bernardes prison.The PCC leaders may have suspected a betrayal on the part of Marcola. In 2002, Cesinha was suspected of ordering Olivatto’s murder, and Geleião reportedly provided authorities with information that led to the arrest of several members of Marcola’s inner circle that year. Nevertheless, Marcola seemed to retain the trust of other members of the PCC and took over as the group's top leader. He began establishing a new prison-based communications network that relied on a team of lawyers to pass messages between imprisoned leaders.Under Marcola’s leadership, the PCC expanded outside of prison walls and started to function as an increasingly sophisticated criminal organization involved in lucrative illicit activities like drug trafficking. In 2006, after authorities announced plans to move hundreds of prisoners, including Marcola, into higher-security prison conditions, the PCC organized a series of huge prison rebellions and coordinated attacks in São Paulo that left more than 150 dead and brought the city to a virtual standstill.In the aftermath of the deadly 2006 attacks, Marcola gained cult notoriety in Brazil when a fictitious “interview,” attributed to the PCC leader was published by O Globo columnist Arnaldo Jabor, which stoked fears about criminal violence and control. In 2017 and 2018, the same fake interview was recirculated on social media and messaging platforms like WhatsApp, shining a spotlight on Marcola once again.The interview was an illustration of both the PCC’s real and virtual control of many areas in Brazil. The group acts as a parallel state in much of the country, administering justice, providing employment and giving protection from other, rival predatory criminal organizations or from state security forces.Throughout Marcola’s prison sentence, he has continued to act as the PCC’s top leader despite being moved to different prisons around Brazil and put into long-term isolation. In 2014, he had to be relocated after officials discovered the PCC was planning to free him using a helicopter painted with military designs. A similar plan was thwarted in 2018, and required that Marcola and 21 other top PCC members be moved again.In February of that year, Marcola was also sentenced to an additional 30 years in prison for directing the network of lawyers that helped exchange messages between the PCC’s imprisoned leaders and paid bribes on behalf of the criminal group to public officials.","Marcola gained notoriety as a bank robber before moving up the ranks of the PCC, and eventually taking on the role of the group’s top leader. Under his management, the PCC has expanded its drug and arms trafficking activities across Brazil and in neighboring countries like Bolivia and Paraguay.","Although Marcola has been imprisoned in various prisons in São Paulo for much of the last three decades, under his leadership, the PCC has expanded its reach far beyond its stronghold in Brazil’s most populous and economically important state. The group has established a presence in many areas across Brazil, it has developed ties in nearly every country in South America, and it has formed relationships with several European crime groups.","Authorities had identified Gilberto Aparecido Dos Santos, alias ""Fuminho,"" as the PCC's second-in-command and top member not behind bars. However, Fuminho was arrested in Mozambique and extradited back to Brazil in 2020.Several other top leaders, including Rogério Jeremias de Simone, alias ""Gegê del Mangue,"" and Fabiano Alves de Souza, alias ""Paca,"" were killed in 2018 for stealing money from the organization. Marcola's brother Alejandro Juvenal Herbas Camacho Júnior, alias ""Marcolinha,"" continues to assist with oversight of PCC operations from prison. In 2022, Marcos Roberto de Almeida, alias ""Tuta,"" appears to be the PCC's leader outside prison, having reportedly been handpicked by Marcola.Marcola's rivals include members of the Rio de Janeiro-based Red Command (Comando Vermelho) as well as the Third Capital Command (Terceiro Comando da Capital - TCC).","Although Marcola has spent the majority of his life behind bars, like many Brazilian crime bosses, he has reportedly continued to develop his criminal career from inside prison, using a network of lawyers and corrupt public officials. While the dismantling of this communications network and loss of some key leaders posed potential disruptions to the PCC's business, Marcola appears to have maintained firm control working through his long-time associate Fuminho.Since Fuminho was arrested, Marcola appears to have remained in control by appointing Marcos Roberto de Almeida, alias ""Tuta,"" as his chosen successor on the outside."
"José Bayron Piedrahita Ceballos, alias 'El Árabe,' or the 'Patron de Caucasia'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/jose-bayron-piedrahita-ceballos/,José Bayron Piedrahita Ceballos,"El Árabe, or the Patron de Caucasia",./images/individuals/josé-bayron-piedrahita-ceballos.jpg,2019-05-10,"['colombia mafia', 'colombia personalities']",colombia,"José Bayron Piedrahita Ceballos is presumed to be one of the biggest drug lords in Colombia. During his criminal career spanning more than 20 years, Piedrahita managed to stay out of the authorities’ spotlight and consolidate his power. Though Piedrahita was surrounded by well-renowned capos, he managed to conceal his illegal activities thanks his facade as a successful rancher and businessman.His businesses -- like the Cattle Auction of Caucausia, Del Cauca Refrigeration and the Contadora Rice Company -- were some of the biggest job creators in Colombia’s Bajo Cauca region in the center-western department of Antioquia. It is likely that Piedrahita was extremely well-connected in the political sphere. Despite his obvious links to drug trafficking, he has never stood trial in Colombia.Piedrahita was a key player in the drug trafficking and money laundering businesses in the 1990s. Authorities believe Piedrahita began his criminal career guarding cocaine laboratories for the Cali Cartel, and that later he became directly involved with Gilberto and Miguel Rodríguez Orejuela. After the death of Pablo Escobar, Piedrahita returned to Antioquia to become the kingpin of Bajo Cauca. For years, he was one the most influential actors in the region’s underworld, allowing him to generate close ties with drug traffickers and paramilitary commanders operating in the region.On September 29, 2017, Piedrahita was captured in one of his estates in Antioquia, charged with obstruction of justice and corruption in a US court. Piedrahita had allegedly bribed a US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer to tamper with records in a criminal case that implicated himself and 18 other former Cali Cartel members. In 1991, US customs and officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) launchedOperation Angular Stone in an attempt to unravel the Cali Cartel’s illegal financial network. In 1993, authorities established that Piedrahita was an important part of this scheme, which eventually led them to the illegally modified court file that the ICE officer had fudged. US officials renewed their interest in Piedrahita in June 2014, when the Treasury Department initiated an investigation into the financial apparatus of the Oficina de Envigado, a powerful Colombian criminal organization that was included on the US ""Kingpin List.""Shortly before his arrest, Piedrahita was on the radar of Argentine authorities for his involvement in a network of money laundering schemes in the south of the country. Authorities said he may have laundered as much as $15 million through various businesses, including a cafe in Buenos Aires and a government railroad construction project. Apparently, well-known criminals participated in the network, including Victoria Henao and Juan Pablo Escobar -- the widow and son of Pablo Escobar -- now known as María Isabel Santos and Sebastián Marroquín.The network also included members of the Oficina de Envigado, the soccer player Mauricio “El Chico” Serna, and high-profile Argentine businessmen Mateo Corvo Dulcet and Antonio Pedro Ruiz.Piedrahita was extradited to the United States in April of 2019 where he pled guilty to bribing a special agent from the US Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit to drop a drug trafficking indictment against him.","Although Peidrahita’s direct participation in Colombian drug trafficking shouldn’t be ruled out, he is better known for laundering money through various companies in support of drug trafficking. For instance, Piedrahita was a shareholder of the Caucasia Cattle Auction (Subasta Ganadera de Caucasia S.A., or Subagauca), which was reported for suspicious financial activity related to its massive profits and rapid asset growth.Authorities suspect that the company’s growth could be related to the drug business. According to authorities, Piedrahita may have used a technique called “smurfing” to bypass financial regulations, although his illicit finances eventually garnered unwanted attention. El Espectador reported that “financial institutions are legally obliged to report all transactions over $10 million to the authorities. In the case of Subagauca … all of the company’s transactions were between $9 million and $9.9 million. It raised suspicion, and for the authorities, the company’s financial activity was just as significant as transactions that amounted to over $10 million.”","Although Piedrahita had important connections with the Cali Cartel and later with the Norte del Valle Cartel, his region of influence and the center of his operations were in Bajo Cauca in the department of Antioquia, an area known for strong presence of illegal armed groups engaged in drug trafficking. There, Piedrahita was known as the “Dueño de Caucasia” for his large, legal businesses, as well as for his influence in regional politics. Before his capture, Piedrahita was expanding his criminal activities into Argentina.","Before his capture, Piedrahita relied on extensive connections to many of Colombia’s most notorious drug traffickers. His involvement in the underworld initially began with the Cali Cartel. After the fall of that organization, however, he allied himself with the Norte del Valle Cartel, and later with the paramilitary commanders that operated in Bajo Cauca in Antioquia. It is believe that Piedrahita had connections with Ramiro Vanoy, alias “Cuco Vanoy,” the boss of the Miner’s Bloc of the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) who committed various crimes in Bajo Cauca, Antioquia. Piedrahita also had connections with Carlos Mario Jiménez, alias “Macaco,” commander of the Central Bolívar Unit of the AUC.John E. Smith, the acting director of the US Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), stated that Piedrahita ""is a long-time supporter of drug cartels, including the Cali and North Valle cartels, and now La Oficina de Envigado."" Although Piedrahita claimed to have helped bring down Carlos Mario Aguilar, alias “Rogelio,” a former member of the Attorney General's Office Technical Investigation Unit (Cuerpo Técnico de Investigación - CTI) who ran the Oficina de Envigado during his final years as a career criminal. His most important partners were Jorge Luís and Juan David Ochoa Vásquez, two brothers and ex-Cali Cartel members who also participated in the Subagauca laundering scheme.",Piedrahita was previously being held in the Special Treatment Unit (Unidad de Tratamiento Especial - UTE) in the Picota prison in Bogotá before being extradited to the United States in April 2019. He will be sentenced in July 2019 after entering into a plea agreement with US authorities.,

He has traditionally been one of the ELN’s most belligerent commanders and was critical of peace talks between the ELN and the Colombian government. He was the commander of the Domingo Laín Sáenz Front until 2015 and was appointed third-in-command of the group in June 2021 following the resignation of Nicolás Rodríguez Bautista, alias ""Gabino.""","Pablito is a native of Sarare, born into one of the first families to colonize the region and which had longstanding relations with the ELN. He was recruited into the ranks of the group in 1982 by Jaime Quiroz in Arauquita.The Domingo Laín Sanz Front saw an opportunity to take advantage of the oil boom in Caño Limón, Arauca. It began to gain control of the department by extorting the oil multinationals as well as carrying out extortion and kidnapping. This allowed Pablito to progressively show his capacity for leadership.By 1989, when Jesus Emilio Jaramillo, the Bishop of Arauca, began protesting against the actions of the ELN, Pablito personally ordered and directed his murder.[1] This became a turning point for the ELN in Arauca as their new leaders, including Pablito, no longer held back in their use of violence.In 1993, Pablito was already a leader within the Compañía Simacota. In 1995, he carried out his first international operation, leading an attack against the Carabobo military base in the Venezuelan state of Apure.By 1998, he was commanding the Compañía Simacota, which was active around Arauquita.[2] In 2000, he became the commander of the Domingo Laín Sáenz Front of the Eastern War Front (Frente Domingo Laín Sáenz del Frente Oriental de Guerra). During his leadership, the Domingo Laín Sáenz Front grew its military strength and capabilities, and its influence in Arauca increased.The Colombian army arrested Pablito in Bogotá in 2008, but in 2009 he escaped from prison in spectacular fashion. Since then, authorities in Colombia have put a $600,000 price on his head.At the Fifth ELN Congress in 2015, it was announced that Pablito would join the COCE, the group's central command. However, he rejected this appointment, showing that the Front he commands had severe reservations about positions being put forth by the COCE.Despite reservations about peace talks, in May 2018, he traveled to Havana, Cuba, for negotiations with the Colombian government, along with other senior members of the ELN. But in January 2019, the talks collapsed after the ELN set off a car bomb outside a police training school in Bogotá, killing 21 people.That same month, Colombia offered up a reward of up to 4 billion Colombian pesos ($1 million) for any information leading to the capture of ELN leaders, including Pablito, Gabino and Eliécer Erlinto Chamorro, alias “Antonio García.""Since then, Pablito has remained in Cuba, along with much of the COCE and the ELN's negotiating team. Colombia and the United States have continuously piled on the pressure for Cuba to extradite the ELN leadership, including Pablito, but Havana has categorically refused.In April 2021, rumors circulated that Pablito had died from natural causes in Cuba. The guerrilla group rapidly dismissed this as false and said he remained in good health.In June 2021, Pablito was confirmed as the ELN’s third-in-command overall under the command of “Antonio García,"" and with Israel Ramírez Pineda, alias “Pablo Beltrán,” as second-in-command.","Pablito is being sought by the United States on arms trafficking charges and for the kidnapping of American journalists. According to information from authorities, Pablito controlled drug trafficking routes in western Colombia, as well as in Venezuela. He is also accused of kidnapping, extortion, and attacks on oil infrastructure.The last high-profile action allegedly commanded by Pablito was the car bomb attack against the Santander General Police School in Bogotá in January 2019, which killed 21 people.Pablito is also considered to have played a key role in setting up the ELN inside Venezuela. After escaping prison in 2009, Venezuela went from being the Eastern War Front’s hideout to serving as its command center for both military and financial operations. In the state of Apure, his men began creating connections among local communities. InSight Crime investigations found that children in communities under the ELN's control in Apure were taught about imperialism, class struggle, and the legitimacy of the ELN’s revolution in school.","Pablito is the commander of the ELN's Eastern War Front, which operates in Colombia and Venezuela. According to reports, the guerrilla boss has moved easily between the Colombian department of Arauca and the state of Apure in Venezuela where he was understood to have set up his command center.When most of the ELN's COCE went to Cuba to negotiate with the Colombian government and ended up stuck there when the talks failed, Pablito remained in the field. One expert in Colombian peace negotiations told InSight Crime that ""[Pablito] took advantage of the obvious disconnection between the COCE in Havana and the political and military structures in Colombia and Venezuela to make these structures grow in the way he wanted.""While it is uncertain where Pablito is currently based, he remains one of the foremost commanders of the ELN with broad authority over ELN troops in Colombia and Venezuela. The group's Colombia strongholds are in Arauca and Vichada, along the Venezuela border, and in the departments of Chocó, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Nariño along the Pacific Coast. In Venezuela, It has consolidated its presence in the states of Zulia, Táchira, Apure and Anzoátegui, while gaining a presence in the states of Amazonas, Bolívar, Barinas, Trujillo, Portuguesa, Lara, Falcón, and Guárico.","Pablito is a respected veteran within the ranks of the ELN and has broad authority in the insurgent organization's military decisions. His arrival at the COCE in 2015 was seen by many analysts as a strategic decision by the high command of the ELN to join the peace negotiations with the government at the time and attract those who rejected this initiative.With the presence of ex-FARC mafia groups in Venezuelan territory, old friendships were reborn that had a more criminal than political tint. According to information from the Colombian media, members of the ELN, who had Pablito's approval, were dispatched in Apure in 2018 with the Second Marquetalia led by Iván Márquez in order to divide drug trafficking corridors and charges.","It is widely believed that Pablito continues to command the ELN's Eastern War Front from El Nula, in the Venezuelan state of Apure. With the retirement of Gabino as head of the ELN in June 2021, Pablito has positioned himself as one of the commanders with the greatest power within the guerrilla group. Given the role he has played in expanding the ELN's presence in Colombia and Venezuela, getting Pablito to the negotiating table is a must for any peace talks to succeed. Should Pablito distance himself from the peace talks begun with President Gustavo Petro, this would deal a major blow to the peace process. And yet Pablito has always been cautious regarding such negotiations, as evidenced by him not joining the former ELN negotiating team in Cuba.His stance on Petro's ""Total Peace"" plan is unknown, although early talks between the ELN and the Colombian government have begun."

Since the guerrilla group disbanded after the 2016 peace process, John 40 has maintained a lavish lifestyle, connecting cocaine leaving southern Colombia with buyers in Venezuela. He is now also the financial backer for the FARC dissidents led by Miguel Botache, alias ""Gentil Duarte."" The dissident went from being a young man with communist ideals and faith in the insurgent struggle to an extravagant drug lord with a taste for horses, who only wore imported military clothing and handled billions of pesos a year. The power and wealth he has amassed through drug trafficking have made him a top priority target for Colombia, and a key part of the plan to reunite the FARC dissidents.In May 2021, he openly declared himself to be aligned with the Segunda Marquetalia, one of the principal factions of dissident FARC guerrillas in Colombia and Venezuela.","John 40 was born in the municipality of San Martín in the department of Meta on August 23, 1963. He is the grandson of Roque Molina, alias ""El Diablo,"" one of the peasants who took up arms in the 1960s with alias ""Tirofijo"" in Marquetalia in the department of Tolima.His criminal career began in the 1980s when he joined the 31st Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) after spending two years as a secretary in the Communist Youth (Juventudes Comunista - JUCO). In the beginning, John 40 used the name of Francisco Javier Builes to cover up his actions. But as he gained importance within the guerrilla organization, his real name came to light.Shortly after joining the guerrillas, he learned the trade of drug trafficking thanks to Tomás Molina Caracas, alias ""El Negro Acacio,"" who by then was the FARC’s drug czar. In 2006, John 40 was already considered one of Meta department’s drug lords. With extravagant clothes, jewelry and gold watches, luxurious vans and a satellite phone that never left his side, John 40 was acquiring the characteristics of what would be the guerrilla’s most important drug lord. His power in the region was such that as commander of the 43rd Front, he was believed to move up to 100 tons of coca per year, receive billions of pesos for drug trafficking transactions and control almost 5,000 hectares of coca.In 2006, the Colombian government, supported by the United States, implemented operation ""Emperador,"" which gathered 3,200 uniformed men in Meta with the sole objective of capturing John 40.His criminal power increased in 2007, when Negro Acacio died after a military bombing. The FARC Secretariat ordered him to take control of the coca business in the south of the country. As a result, John 40 went on to handle all of the drug trafficking in the departments of Meta and Guaviare, which not only increased his power within the FARC, but also increased his lack of discipline and excesses.In 2008, the Colombian government bombed his camp, leaving him severely wounded and striking the structure of the 43rd Front. Due to this, in 2010, the FARC Secretariat carried out a ""revolutionary trial"" against John 40. He was accused of a growing lack of discipline, ""bad"" drug trafficking practices and weakening his front. The results of this war council weren’t clear, but some sources said that John 40 was under the direct orders of a member of the Secretariat. On the other hand, other sources indicated that there were no reprimands against the 43rd Front’s commander, and that he instead fled to Venezuela after the bombing.John 40 surfaced again in 2012 when men under his command clashed with the military in the jungles of the department of Guainía. That same year he was identified as having founded the ""Acacio Medina"" Front in the municipality of Maroa across the border in Venezuela.With the beginning of the peace talks between the Colombian government and the FARC Secretariat, John 40 was considered the main financier of the Eastern Bloc, mainly due to his control over the commercialization of cocaine in Colombia’s border regions with Venezuela and Brazil, and his ties with drug traffickers from both countries.By 2015, John 40 was named as one of the commanders who would not participate in the FARC’s demobilization process. In fact, the National Anti-Narcotic and Money Laundering Directorate (Dirección Nacional de Antinarcóticos y Lavado de Activos) accused John 40 of continued involvement in criminal activities in Meta.His distancing from the peace process was confirmed in 2016, when he announced that he would not demobilize with the guerrillas. Soon after, the FARC Secretariat officially expelled him from their ranks along with four other commanders. By December of that year, the national authorities identified John 40 as a high-value target, while Interpol issued a red alert against him.Until recently, John 40 was believed to be one of the key operators in Gentil Duarte's plan to bring together FARC dissident factions into a single fighting force. In mid-2018, he was sent by Duarte to the Catatumbo region of Norte de Santander to lead the 33rd Front, coordinate the purchasing of coca paste in that region and regain control of drug trafficking route into Venezuela.","When he belonged to the FARC, John 40 controlled international cocaine shipment routes from Meta and Guaviare. He was in charge of relations with drug buyers in Colombia’s border regions with Brazil and Venezuela, and guaranteed them that at least 100 tons of cocaine would be trafficked per year. His profits were counted in the billions of pesos, making him one of the main economic suppliers of the FARC’s Eastern Bloc.The power of John 40 gave him the label of one of the FARC’s greatest drug lords. It was even said that he controlled his own town in the rural area of the municipality of Puerto Rico in the department of Meta.John 40 also meddled in different structures to launder dirty money from cocaine trafficking. He shaped a network of frontmen through which he bought estates and luxurious properties in the main capitals of the country, while he built bars, hotels and clubs in Meta with drug money.After the demobilization of the FARC, John 40 managed the commercialization of Colombian cocaine into Venezuela through alliances with drug trafficking groups in that country. During his time in Catatumbo, he also made contact with FARC dissidents in that region and sought to avoid their recruitment by other groups such as the ELN or the Urabeños.Authorities have accused him of recruiting minors and taking them to training camps on the Venezuelan side of the border, particularly in the states of Amazonas, Táchira and Apure. He is known to have around 500 men under his command in Venezuela, mostly in the state of Amazonas.Finally, he has been linked to the exploitation of gold and coltan from Venezuela and is believed to have links with drug gangs in Brazil.In May 2021, he openly declared himself to be aligned with the Segunda Marquetalia, one of the principal factions of dissident FARC guerrillas in Colombia and Venezuela.","When John 40 commanded the 43rd Front, his area of control lay in the department of Meta. Currently, he moves between the Colombian department of Guaviare and the Venezuelan department of Amazonas.Colombian authorities have reported that dissidents under his command use the departments of Vichada and Guainía to cross into Venezuela, where they maintain a cocaine stockpile in the Yapacana mountain range.","John 40's main allies were long believed to be Miguel Botache Santillana, alias 'Gentil Duarte,' and Néstor Gregorio Verá, alias 'Iván Mordisco,' leaders of the 7th and 1st Fronts respectively. Beyond being one of the main financial backers for these two fronts, John 40 was thought to have become a strong ally of Duarte in his mission to unite the FARC dissidents.However, in May 2021, he appeared in a video produced by the Segunda Marquetalia to commemorate the 57th anniversary of the FARC's existence. This seemingly innocuous appearance confirmed that John 40 had switched sides from Gentil Duarte to Iván Márquez and marking one of the more important power plays since the end of the FARC.In so doing, he likely made an enemy of Gentil Duarte and Iván Mordisco, and became a solid ally of Márquez's commanders, including Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias “Romaña,” and Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias ""El Paisa.""","John 40's importance within Colombia's criminal landscape has rapidly increased in recent years as he controls important drug trafficking routes along the Venezuelan and Brazilian borders, while he has also become crucial in creating alliances with foreign cartels.While his role is more criminal than ideological, his controversial history within the FARC guerrilla group, his former partnership with Duarte and his current alliance with the Segunda Marquetalia has made him a crucial part of the plan to unite the dissidents.It is currently unclear what relations Gentil Duarte and his allies maintain with another faction of ex-FARC Mafia, led by influential commanders Luciano Marín Arango, alias ‘Iván Márquez,’ Seuxis Pausías Hernández Solarte, alias ‘Jesús Santrich,’ and Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias ‘El Paisa,’ who declared their return to arms in August 2019."
"Néstor Gregorio Vera Fernández, alias 'Iván Mordisco'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/nestor-gregorio-vera-fernandez-alias-ivan-mordisco/,Néstor Gregorio Vera Fernández,Iván Mordisco,./images/individuals/néstor-gregorio-vera-fernández.jpg,2022-10-17,"['colombia personalities', 'ex-farc mafia', 'farc', 'farc peace', 'iván mordisco']",colombia,"Nestor Gregorio Vera Fernández, alias “Iván Mordisco,” is one of the most important FARC dissident commanders in Colombia. Until 2016, he served as commander of the 1st Front of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). But in June of that year, he became the first commander to abandon the peace process between the rebel group and the Colombian government. He commanded the dissident 1st Front, made up of approximately 400 members and present across the departments of Guaviare, Vaupés, Meta and Vichada. It also established a significant presence inside Venezuela, especially near the Colombian border.Following the death of Miguel Botache Santillana, alias “Gentil Duarte,” in Venezuela in May 2022, Iván Mordisco assumed the leadership of dissident fronts formerly under Duarte's command.On July 11, it was reported that a camp belonging to Mordisco's men in the Colombian state of Caquetá was attacked by Army forces, killing at least 10 people. On July 15, Colombian authorities confirmed Mordisco was among those slain.In October 2022, Mordisco confirmed rumors that he was still alive by appearing in a video stating that the political aims of the FARC had not changed.","Iván Mordisco began his criminal activities upon joining the FARC in the late 1990s. He began as a foot soldier, but quickly specialized as a sniper and explosives expert within the Armando Ríos Front in San José del Guaviare.His rise within the FARC began in 2008, when he temporarily served as commander of the 1st Front due to the capture of its leader Gerardo Aguilar, alias 'Cesar.' In 2009, Marco Fidel Suárez, alias 'Kokoriko,' took control of the front, and Iván Mordisco became the head of the 1st Front’s ""public order operations"" in Guaviare and Vaupés. Until 2012, he focused on forced recruitment and illicit crop protection in both departments before again becoming commander of the 1st Front.In 2015, Iván Mordisco was briefly captured by the Army Special Anti-Drug Trafficking Brigade (Brigada Especial Contra el Narcotraficante) in a rural area of Miraflores municipality. However, the guerrilla commander was quickly released although details of this incident are lacking.By 2016, it was clear that Iván Mordisco did not support the peace process. He solidified his stance by sending a letter to the FARC negotiating team in Cuba, making it clear that the 1st Front would not demobilize. Additionally, he invited all ""guerrillas and militia members"" who did not agree with the peace process to ""continue the insurgent struggle."" These statements made him the first senior FARC leader to dissent.Iván Mordisco is reputed as being a particularly violent leader, with disdain for civilian populations. With the blow to the dissident cause that was the death of Edgar Mesías Salgado, alias “Rodrigo Cadete,” Mordisco became a key player in Gentil Duarte's plan to unite the FARC dissidents and had been been tasked with running this operation in northern Colombia.","As commander of the 1st Front since 2012, Iván Mordisco was behind crimes such as the extortion of tradesmen, farmers and other rural inhabitants, illegal mining, and ordered an increase in the planting, processing and trafficking of coca in Guaviare. At the end of that year, the Ombudsman's Office reported that the organization, already in open dissent, forcibly recruited an unknown number of youths in rural Miraflores.Iván Mordisco controlled illicit crop cultivation, illegal mining and drug routes corridors for the transport of cocaine through Guaviare, Vaupés, Vichada and the south of Meta. The 1st Front has also opened drug trafficking routes through northern Amazonas, in the area of Puerto Córdoba and La Pedrera, where the Apaporis and Caquetá rivers provide a route to Brazil.Over the course of 2020 and 2021, while Mordisco was personally been sighted, operations continued to weaken his forces. In April 2021, the Colombian Attorney General’s Office said a severe blow had been dealt to Mordisco’s financial and logistical capabilities due to arrests of key personnel. In September 2021, three members of the 1st Front were reportedly gunned down by the Colombian Army in Arauca.The 1st Front has also been reportedly engaged in regular clashes with forces of the Segunda Marquetalia, a rival dissident FARC group. Sensationally, forces under Mordisco are even alleged to have assassinated Seuxis Paucias Hernández Solarte, alias ""Jesús Santrich,"" one of the most notable former FARC commanders, inside Venezuela, although this has not been confirmed.In 2022, with the death of Gentil Duarte, Mordisco temporarily became the leader of the Western Coordinating Command (Comando Coordinador de Occidente - CCO) and commander of the 1st and 7th Fronts of the ex–FARC Mafia.","Iván Mordisco was believed to be based in the department of Guaviare, particularly around the municipalities of Calamar, Miraflores and San José del Guaviare. His most important area of control is the Barranquillita area of Miraflores.He controlled territory along the Guaviare river, close to the villages of En Charras, Puerto Alegre, Barranco Colorado, Puerto Alvira and Mocuare.His 1st Front had also established a significant presence inside Venezuela, especially near the Colombian border.","Iván Mordisco's closest alliance was with Gentil Duarte, who commanded the 7th Front until his death in Venezuela in 2022, and led an operation to reunite FARC dissidents across Colombia into a unified fighting structure. Mordisco is now reportedly in command of the project begun by Duarte, which includes several ex-FARC groups in Cauca, Nariño, Putumayo, Norte de Santander and Arauca, among others.Iván Mordisco and his allies are now in open conflict with another faction of the ex-FARC Mafia, the Second Marquetalia, led by influential commander Luciano Marín Arango, alias 'Iván Márquez,' It is believed Mordisco may have been behind the killing of another top Second Marquetalia leader, Seuxis Pausías Hernández Solarte, alias 'Jesús Santrich,' in Venezuela in May 2021. Mordisco was even rumored to have ordered an attack against Iván Márquez in June 2022 in Venezuela although this has not been confirmed.However, both Mordisco's faction and the Second Marquetalia have been left rudderless in 2022, with the deaths of so many ex-FARC Mafia commanders in quick succession.","Since abandoning the FARC peace process, and following the death of Gentil Duarte, Iván Mordisco temporarily became the most important leader of the ex-FARC Mafia in Colombia and Venezuela.His strength lay in the 1st Front's current manpower — and the 14 dissident groups in 17 departments of Colombia that Duarte was leading at the time of his death — as well as control over international drug trafficking routes leading to Brazil and Venezuela and a network of alliances with dissidents in and outside of Colombia.Though Mordisco was the natural successor to lead large parts of the ex-FARC Mafia, he is known for having a difficult and conflicting personality. He is unlikely to succeed in furthering plans to reunite the ex-FARC Mafia.Confirmation in October 2022 that he survived the attack on his life earlier in the year means he may again play a key role in any attempt by President Gustavo Petro to encourage the ex-FARC mafia to demobilize."
"Dámaso López Núñez, alias 'Licenciado'",https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/damaso-lopez-nunez-alias-licenciado/,Dámaso López Núñez,Licenciado,./images/individuals/dámaso-lópez-núñez.jpg,2018-07-09,"['mexico', 'mexico personalities', 'sinaloa cartel']",mexico,"Dámaso López Núñez, alias ""Licenciado,"" is a prominent figure of the Sinaloa Cartel. Authorities believe he was the closest associate of legendary kingpin Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, who was arrested in January 2016 and extradited to the United States a year later. Following El Chapo's capture, Licenciado became one of the most visible faces of the Sinaloa Cartel and was presumed to become El Chapo's replacement. However, this is unlikely to occur now given Licenciado's subsequent May 2017 arrest and July 2018 extradition to the United States.","Born February 22, 1966 in the state of Sinaloa, Licenciado studied law at university and later began working for the state prosecutor's office in Sinaloa. By 1999 he became a top official in the branch of prison administration system that focused on maximum-security institutions, including the Puente Grande penitentiary in Jalisco where El Chapo was detained.According to Mexican and US police sources, Licenciado established a network of corrupted prison guards and was personally responsible for organizing El Chapo's escape from Puente Grande on January 19, 2001. A few months before Guzman's prison break, Licenciado had resigned from his post at Puente Grande.After the escape, Licenciado joined the Sinaloa Cartel and gradually became one of Guzman's closest allies. Mexican journalist Ánabel Hernández wrote that ""during 15 years in the service of 'El Chapo,' [Licenciado] constructed his own criminal structure that includes buying off authorities through large bribes and a wide network in Mexico, the United States, Central and South America dedicated to drug trafficking.""El Chapo was re-arrested by Mexican authorities in February 2014, and he reportedly turned over his leadership responsibilities within the Sinaloa Cartel to Licenciado while he was incarcerated. El Chapo managed to escape from prison once again in July 2015, but he was captured in January 2016 and extradited to the United States almost exactly one year later.The decline of El Chapo's power within the Sinaloa Cartel and the resulting power vacuum gave Licenciado the opportunity to step up his illegal activities and fight against rival groups for the control of territories and drug trafficking routes formerly managed by El Chapo.Licenciado was arrested in May 2017 in Mexico City before being able to fully consolidate power within the Sinaloa Cartel. He was extradited to the United States on July 6, 2018.","US authorities have accused Licenciado of being deeply involved in the Sinaloa Cartel's drug trafficking activities. In January 2013, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) sanctioned Licenciado for his ""significant role in international narcotics trafficking,"" alleging that he was responsible for multi-ton shipments of narcotics from Mexico to the United States. In March 2013, US federal prosecutors indicted Licenciado on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering, alleging that the proceeds of his criminal activities amounted to some $280 million.","Licenciado is originally from Sinaloa, and he is believed to operate in his home state as well as in Baja California Sur. Reports indicate that he has also maintained connections in drug production countries like Colombia and Peru, as well as in transit nations like Panama.","Evidence suggests that Licenciado was looking for ways to fill the power vacuum that El Chapo's capture left behind before his own subsequent arrest. In February 2017, Licenciado allegedly attempted to kill the leader of another Sinaloa Cartel faction, Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada, as well as two of El Chapo's sons, but the attack did not succeed. The incident led authorities believe that Licenciado was fighting for a place at the top of the Sinaloa Cartel, putting him in potential conflict with other factions of the organization, a factor which may have played a role in his capture.Licenciado's son, Dámaso López Serrano, alias ""Mini Lic,"" is reportedly following his father's footsteps. Reports indicate that Mini Lic became involved in drug trafficking from an early age and began leading a youth faction of the Sinaloa Cartel, which dubbed themselves Los Antrax.","After being captured for a second time in February 2014, El Chapo reportedly claimed that Licenciado would be his successor. Captured yet again in January 2016 and finally extradited to the United States only a year later, El Chapo's statement is unlikely to be fulfilled now that Licenciado has been captured and faces extradition.Rival factions of the Sinaloa Cartel are currently fighting against each other, while other major drug trafficking organizations across Mexico are trying to penetrate into territories formerly under the Sinaloa Cartel's control. In this state of flux, Licenciado's capture leaves the cartel further weakened and at risk of continued fragmentation, serving as a reminder that the struggle for power within the Sinaloa Cartel is all but finished."

He was arrested in February 2016 but was released in April 2017 under suspicious circumstances. He was killed in 2018 in a shootout with Colombian police in Medellín.Pachón was for years an obscure character who worked his way through the ranks of the country’s biggest cartels before finally taking over the drug trafficking empire of kingpin Daniel “El Loco” Barrera and command of the criminal armed groups the Meta Bloc (Bloque Meta) and Liberators of Vichada (Libertadores de Vichada), now collectively referred to as the Puntilleros.","Pachón cut his teeth in Colombia’s underworld as a stable boy and subsequently a hired assassin for the Medellín Cartel. He later worked with the Norte del Valle Cartel, and began to rise in the underworld after setting up his own cocaine processing laboratories in the departments of Valle del Cauca and Caquetá.Pachón arrived in Colombia’s Eastern Plains at the end of the 1990s, where he used his earnings to buy large swaths of land in the departments of Meta, Guaviare and Vichada. By 1998, he was forging ties with major drug boss Daniel “El Loco” Barrera, who dominated drug trafficking in the Eastern Plains from 2003 until his capture in 2012. Together, they ran drug trafficking routes into the United States and Europe.However, the relationship between Pachón and Barrera soured, and Pachón was even rumored to have provided the information that led to Barrera’s capture in 2012. With Barrera subsequently extradited to the United States, Pachón made his move to establish himself as the region’s principal kingpin, ordering the assassination of a number of Barrera’s lieutenants who resisted his power play.While Pachón had a reputation within his criminal circle for his violent retaliations against people he considered to be threatening or untrustworthy, he managed to maintain a low profile for years. The investigation that led to Pachón’s capture began in 2013, when police discovered a cocaine laboratory capable of processing 500 to 600 kilograms of the drug per week in Mapiripán, Meta.On February 26, 2016, the crime boss was arrested in a rural area of Cimitarra municipality, Santander. However, he was released in April 2017, before being immediately detained and then released again. The Attorney General’s Office announced it was investigating potential irregularities in the judicial decisions shortly after Pachón was freed the second time.","Pachón is alleged to have overseen the cultivation of coca crops, cocaine laboratories, and trafficking routes, and run his own network of hitmen.","Pachón’s main area of operations was the Eastern Plains, Colombia’s vast lowlands that are abundant with coca crops, drug laboratories, and trafficking routes into neighboring Venezuela. As his allies were captured or killed, Pachón’s influence spread across their former territories and into the departments of Norte de Santander, Meta, and Vichada.Pachón’s tentacles reached the capital city of Bogotá, where he has reportedly provided contract killing services.","Pachón’s principal alliance was with Daniel “El Loco” Barrera, although he turned on what remained of Barrera’s network after the drug lord’s arrest and extradition.Following Barrera’s departure, Pachón reportedly established alliances with the leader of the narco-guerrillas the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL), Víctor Ramón Navarro, alias “Megateo,” in Norte de Santander, and Urabeños leader Dairo Antonio Úsuga, alias “Otoniel.”He was also an ally of Martín Farfán Díaz González, alias “Pijarbey” or “Pijarvey,"" the leader of the Libertadores de Vichada who was killed in September 2015. At the time of his arrest, Pachón was considered a leading figure in the criminal organizations Libertadores de Vichada and Meta Bloc, splinter groups formed following the breakup of the neo-paramilitary group the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia (Ejército Revolucionario Popular Antiterrorista Colombiano – ERPAC). Such was his influence, that the two criminal networks became collectively known as the “Puntilleros”","Little had been heard of Pachón prior to his death. While he may have returned to the Eastern Plains after he was released in 2017 to resume oversight of the drug trafficking empire there, he could have attempted to go underground.According to the Colombian Attorney-General’s Office, Puntilla was in Medellin after reaching an agreement to receive protection from the Oficina de Envigado gang in exchange for information about the drug trafficking routes through the Eastern Plains.His death may open up a power vacuum within the Puntilleros organization. But there had been indications that Puntilla was seeking to withdraw from the criminal lifestyle and his passing is unlikely to bring about major changes in the underworld of Colombia's Eastern Plains."

In the process, he has become one of Mexico's most wanted.","El Mencho is from the Tierra Caliente region of the western state of Michoacán. According to an April 2015 press release from the US Treasury Department, he has been significantly involved in drug trafficking activities since the 1990s. In 1994, the US District Court for the Northern District of California sentenced him to three years in prison for conspiracy to distribute heroin. Following his release, he returned to Mexico, where he served as a police officer in Cabo Corrientes and Tomatlán in the state of Jalisco. In time, however, he would leave the police to continue his drug trafficking activities and join the Milenio Cartel.After first working in the assassin network that protected Armando Valencia Cornelio, alias ""El Maradona,"" El Mencho went on to join a Milenio Cartel bloc allied with Sinaloa Cartel capo Ignacio Coronel Villarreal, alias ""Nacho Coronel."" This group moved drugs, managed finances, and acted as enforcers for the Sinaloa Cartel in the states of Jalisco and Colima.By 2010, however, following the death of Nacho Coronel and capture of Milenio Cartel leader Óscar Orlando Nava Valencia, alias ""El Lobo,"" the Milenio Cartel had split into two factions: ""Los Torcidos"" and ""La Resistencia."" These two divisions engaged in a battle for control over drug trafficking in Jalisco, with Los Torcidos evolving into the present-day CJNG with El Mencho as their leader.Under El Mencho, the CJNG began expanding and consolidating its control over drug trafficking in Jalisco and surrounding states, taking on rival cartels the Zetas and Knights Templar. In August 2012, despite initial reports that he had been captured, El Mencho escaped an operation carried out by Mexican security forces against the CJNG in Guadalajara. In order to impede the work of the police and allow members time to flee, the cartel created dozens of roadblocks, setting fire to vehicles on key roads throughout the city.El Mencho has continued to elude authorities, despite the CJNG's increasing strength -- and aggressive and violent tactics -- resulting in increased attention and pressure from security forces.His lack of personal appearances has also led to increasing rumors that he may have died. In February 2022, reports in the Mexican press suggested El Mencho had been killed in a shootout between the CJNG and some rivals.While there has been no evidence about this theory, it is known El Mencho has had health problems. In July 2020, he reportedly built a medical facility in rural Jalisco where he could be treated for a long-term kidney problem. Another rumor, which enemies of the CJNG have written on narcomantas, stated that El Mencho had died of kidney failure at a hospital in Guadalajara.Uncertainty about his health status has begun to affect the group. The Mezcales, a splinter faction of the CJNG in Colima, publicly ended their allegiance to the larger cartel in early 2022, claiming that El Mencho had died. The Mexican government has investigated these claims but has not found compelling information either way.","As head of the CJNG, El Mencho directs the group's drug trafficking operations through the states of Jalisco, Colima and Guanajuato, where the cartel is a major player in the methamphetamine trade.El Mencho is also thought to have ordered several assassinations of Mexican politicians. In March 2013, a suspect in the murder of Jalisco's Tourism Secretary Jesús Gallegos Álvarez said El Mencho had authorized the hit based on the suspicion that the official was working for the Knights Templar. The CJNG is also believed to be behind the September 2014 assassination of Congressman Gabriel Gómez Michel. While the motive was unclear, Michel was the former mayor of El Grullo, a CJNG stronghold in Jalisco state where El Mencho reportedly moves around freely.","The CJNG has established a presence in 28 Mexican states, including Mexico City, with its base of operations in Jalisco and Colima.The cartel uses Pacific routes to move drugs, importing cocaine from Colombia and fentanyl from China through the port of Manzanillo in Colima. He has contacts in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, and throughout Central America and the United States.El Mencho reportedly has his personal base of operations around the municipality of El Grullo and other remote parts of Jalisco. Given that he has been off the radar for years, it is unknown to what extent he maintains direct control over CJNG operations across Mexico, although his name and photograph are frequently used by CJNG members nationwide.","A crucial ally for the CJNG has been the Cuinis, a family clan led by Abigael Gonzalez Valencia, the brother of El Mencho's wife, Rosalinda. The Cuinis set up operations across Latin America to help launder the CJNG's colossal profits, including in Argentina and Uruguay. However, since being indicted by the US in 2015, most of the Gonzalez Valencia family have been arrested. The Cuinis have largely ceased to exist as an independent unit and it is believed most of their remaining financial schemes have been absorbed into the CJNG.The CJNG's principal enemies were originally the Zetas and Knights Templar, with the latter beginning a series of wars involving the CJNG in Michoacán. El Mencho was crucial in these early days of the CJNG and was responsible for much of its early strategic expansion.But as the group expanded its control of much of Mexico's criminal landscape, its list of enemies grew. Its principal enemy now is the Sinaloa Cartel, for which it contests control of cocaine and fentanyl trafficking routes across much of central and northern Mexico. Battles between the two have claimed hundreds of lives, if not more, with new hotspots of violence regularly breaking out. In 2021 and 2022, the central state of Zacatecas seems to have become the latest epicenter of Sinaloa-CJNG violence as the two seek to expand their control of fentanyl trafficking. The two have even battled as far away as the Riviera Maya on the Caribbean coast, where drug trafficking and extortion of the tourism industry have been increasing.However, it is involved in a patchwork of regional feuds, including the Northeast Cartel (Cartel del Noreste - CDN) in Tamaulipas, the Old School Zetas (Zetas Vieja Escuela) in Veracruz, and the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel in Guanajuato, although the power of this latter rival has largely been crushed.While videos and messages released by the CJNG have often stated that troops were acting in El Mencho's name, it is unknown to what extent the leader was directing these moves.Most bitterly, the group is involved in a hellish series of conflicts in the southwestern state of Michoacán. The state contains the all-important port of Lázaro Cárdenas, as well as being a crucial area for drug production and trafficking, and offering other criminal economies such as avocado production and extortion. This has made it a priority target for the CJNG as well as the state being the birthplace of El Mencho. However, unlike the rest of Mexico, it has not been unable to impose its criminal will as it has run into well-organized, well-entrenched local groups determined to keep it out.The main opposition is made up of Cárteles Unidos (United Cartels - CU), a coalition of criminal gangs, including the Cartel de Tepalcatepec and the Viagras. This battle has not seen any side come out as the winner but has shut down parts of Michoacán's Tierra Caliente, especially the municipality of Aguililla. Thousands have fled the fighting, with Mexican authorities periodically sending in large forces to regain a semblance of control.The conflict in Michoacán has a far more personal tone for El Mencho. Born in Aguililla, reclaiming that town may be of direct interest to him. Furthermore, the leader of the Cartel de Tepalcatepec, Juan José Farías Álvarez, alias ""El Abuelo,"" used to be a CJNG ally before turning his coat. This seems to have made bringing him down a personal mission for El Mencho.In terms of allies, the CJNG does not seem to keep many for long. The CJNG once allegedly worked closely with the Sinaloa Cartel, now their sworn enemies. El Mencho's son, Rubén Oseguera González, alias ""El Menchito,"" was reportedly an ally of Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán, alias ""El Chapo."" In January 2014, however, El Menchito was captured in Guadalajara. Soon after, the alliance fractured as the CJNG became a rival able to contest the Sinaloa Cartel's dominance.The group has also been willing to make temporary alliances to expand its geographic reach, including in Baja California with the remnants of the Tijuana Cartel, which rebranded itself as the Tijuana Cartel New Generation (Cartel de Tijuana Nueva Generación). In Ciudad Juárez, a key border crossing into the US, the group was supposedly bolstered by an alliance with the New Juárez Cartel (Nuevo Cartel de Juárez) but this does not appear to have helped it establish itself in the city.","The CJNG has become Mexico's most high-profile criminal group, taking over territory and numerous criminal economies, including the trafficking of cocaine, marijuana, methamphetamine, and fentanyl. It also has strong revenue from extortion, avocado production, cigarette trafficking, and human smuggling.While it remains bogged down in plenty of feuds across the country, there is little sense its expansion will soon be stopped. However, if confirmed, the death of the CJNG's talismanic leader, El Mencho, could begin a slow process of fragmentation, which has brought down plenty of the CJNG's predecessors."
"Martin Farfan Diaz Gonzalez, alias 'Pijarbey'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/pijarbey/,Martin Farfan Diaz Gonzalez,Pijarbey,./images/individuals/martin-farfan-diaz-gonzalez.jpg,2016-11-07,"['colombia', 'colombia personalities', 'erpac', 'libertadores del vichada', 'pijarbey']",libertadores,"Martin Farfan Diaz Gonzalez, alias ""Pijarbey"" was a powerful criminal operative in Colombia's Eastern Plains region. He was the leader of the Libertadores del Vichada, a splinter group of the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia (ERPAC) that is dedicated to drug cultivation, processing, and trafficking, as well as hired assassinations. Pijarbey was one of Colombia's most wanted drug traffickers before his death in September 2015.","Pijarbey (also written as ""Pijarvey"") was from the municipality of Puerto Lleras in the Eastern Plains province of Meta. He joined the military as a young man and was assigned to a battalion in Villavicencio, the region's largest city, where he was reportedly one of the unit's most distinguished soldiers.After leaving the military, Pijarbey joined the Centauros Bloc of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC), a paramilitary force dedicated to fighting the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) guerrilla group. When the bloc split into two factions in 2004 following the murder of its leader, Pijarbey joined the Heroes de los Llanos faction and demobilized with the group two years later as part of the paramilitary peace process.Like many former paramilitaries, Pijarbey quickly returned to illegal activity. He helped found the ERPAC with Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero, alias ""Cuchillo"" -- who had secretly stockpiled weapons during the demobilization process -- and became the organization's military commander. In addition to operating cocaine laboratories and overseeing cocaine trafficking from the Eastern Plains province of Vichada into Venezuela, Pijarbey was Cuchillo's main contact with corrupt security officials, who gave him information about upcoming police operations.In December 2009, Pijarbey was arrested in an operation that marked the beginning of a series of captures and killings aimed at dismantling the ERPAC. In spite of the considerable effort authorities had made to capture the ERPAC's military commander -- in an operation involving four police helicopters and some 300 members of an elite military force -- he was only charged with aggravated conspiracy and sentenced to four years in prison. He spent only two years behind bars and was released in January 2012, purportedly for good behavior.With Cuchillo dead, Pijarbey quickly returned to his old stomping grounds and became the leader of a group of his former fighters, who called themselves the Libertadores del Vichada. By February, the group was engaged in a battle against the Meta Bloc, another ERPAC splinter group, for control of ERPAC's drug empire -- which included coca crops, cocaine laboratories, and trafficking routes. Pijarbey allied himself with the powerful criminal syndicate the Urabeños, a move that gave him the upper hand in the battle, and when Meta Bloc leader Rubber Antonio Navarro Caicedo, alias ""Flaco Fredy,"" was captured in September 2012, Pijarbey was well positioned to take over criminal activities in the region.In addition to overseeing drug production and trafficking in the Eastern Plains, Pijarbey's group expanded into the Amazon region near Colombia's southern border. Pijarbey allegedly sent emissaries to the province of Amazonas in 2013 to establish a drug trafficking route, and in less than a year the group had established a network capable of producing 1.5 tons of cocaine a month, and forged ties with Brazilian drug traffickers. Nine men from the Amazonas network were captured in May 2014, however, and it remains unclear whether or not the group's operations in the region continue.In addition to building alliances with criminals such as the Urabeños and Brazilian traffickers, Pijarbey also demonstrated an ability to corrupt local officials to facilitate his criminal activities, including sourcing weapons from military stockpiles.","Pijarbey's group controls all aspects of the drug trade in parts of the Eastern Plains region, overseeing coca cultivation, cocaine processing laboratories, and trafficking routes. The Libertadores del Vichada also includes a network of assassins.","Pijarbey was from Meta and was believed to operate throughout the Eastern Plains region in the provinces of Meta, Vichada, and Guaviare. He also appeared to have expanded operations into the Amazon region near Colombia's southern border with Peru and Brazil, and into the province of Casanare.","Pijarbey forged an alliance with the Urabeños, who supported the group in the battle against their rivals, the Meta Bloc. Colombian authorities are also investigating possible ties to the Oficina de Envigado, after a key Oficina operative, alias ""Cesarin,"" hid out in Pijarbey's territory.Pijarbey's main enemies are the Meta Bloc, particularly the group's leader Edward Alonso Suarez, alias ""Calamisco,"" who used to belong to the Libertadores del Vichada and left the group after a disagreement with Pijarbey led the commander to order his assassination.","In January 2014, authorities captured Pijarbey's right-hand man, Humberto Barrios Orjuela, alias ""Barrios,"" and his financial chief Carlos Hernando Barrera Alfonso, alias ""El Ingeniero."" These two arrests, along with that of Pijarbey's brother in June 2014, led to speculation that police were closing in on the criminal leader. In September 2015, he was killed during a police raid on his hideout in Colombia's eastern department of Vichada."
"Fausto Isidro Meza Flores, alias 'Chapo Isidro'",https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/fausto-isidro-meza-flores-chapo-isidro/,Fausto Isidro Meza Flores,Chapo Isidro,./images/individuals/fausto-isidro-meza-flores.jpg,2016-11-17,"['beltran leyva org', 'hector beltran leyva', 'mexico', 'mexico personalities', 'sinaloa cartel']",mexico,"Fausto Isidro Meza Flores, alias ""Chapo"" or ""Chapito"" Isidro, is a relatively young, formerly low-profile figure believed to have operated in the Mexican underworld since the 1990s. His growing influence in Sinaloa state led the US Treasury Department to designate his network as a Drug Trafficking Organization (DTO) in January 2013.","According to the United States government, Chapo Isidro has been trafficking large quantities of drugs out of Mexico since 2000, operating out of Guasave in Sinaloa state. Other reports claim that he began his criminal career working for Amado Carrillo Fuentes, the one time head of the Juarez Cartel who allegedly died in 1997 following plastic surgery. After Carrillo Fuentes' death, Chapo Isidro began working with the Beltran Leyva Organization, at that time allied with what would later become their rival -- the Sinaloa Cartel.When Alfredo Beltran Leyva was detained in 2008, producing an acrimonious split between the faction led by Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman and the remaining Beltran Leyva brothers, Chapo Isidro remained with the Beltran Leyvas.Reports of Chapo's criminal activities have begun to emerge with more frequency since 2011. In November of that year, he was linked to 32 allegedly corrupt police officers in Ahome, Sinaloa and was also implicated in the murder of 16 people whose burned corpses were found in trucks in Culiacan, slightly further south.Chapo Isidro's exact role in Mexican organized crime continues to be murky. US authorities claim he runs his own organization -- the Meza Flores network -- which operates in Guasave and surrounding towns in northern Sinaloa state, in the geographic area known as the ""Golden Triangle,"" Mexico's drug producing heartland. The group, in which a number of Chapo's family members are also cited as playing key roles, has allegedly trafficked large quantities of cocaine, methamphetamine, marijuana and heroin to the US since 2000.In the statement issued by the US Treasury, the body blamed rivalry between Chapo Isidro and Chapo Guzman for causing the quadrupling of drug-war killings over four years in Sinaloa state. According to Borderland Beat, this war was spurred by the betrayal of one of Chapo Isidro's associates, who deserted and went to work for the Sinaloa Cartel.Other reports indicate Chapo Isidro was the right hand man to the now captured Hector Beltran Leyva and served as a high-level hit man for the larger cartel, leading a group known as the ""Mazatlecos."" His support is believed to havehelped the BLO maintain control of a small fraction of Sinaloa state despite ongoing fighting with the Sinaloa Cartel. Chapo and his group have allegedly clashed with and defeated the ""Los Anthrax"" cell of the Sinaloa Cartel, and they were also cited as major players and victors in a shootout with Sinaloa Cartel enforcers in Tubutama, Sonora state. Chapo Isidro's group is thought to control ranches and farms that produce marijuana and opium poppies for the BLO. After the arrest of Hector Beltran in 2014, numerous reports speculated Cahpo Isidro would be crowned the new head of the BLO, although it is unlikely he could assert centralized authority over the entire organization.Further reports identify Chapo Isidro as the head of a group called the ""Oficina,"" which has a reported presence in Baja California Sur.This group is allegedly composed of members originating from the Familia Michoacana, the Zetas, the Gulf Cartel, and the BLO. Jesus Manuel Reyes Flores, alias ""El Negro,"" an alleged member of the Oficina arrested in 2012, told authorities that the group had murdered dozens of local drug dealers in the municipality of Los Cabos in Baja California Sur.Chapo Isidro has allegedly pulled local police and other authorities into his network, affording him some protection through pay-offs in his areas of operation.He has also proved elusive. A 2010 army operation in Choix, Sinaloa ended in two soldiers and 12 gunmen dead, but Chapo escaped. In December 2013, one of his top deputies, Ignacio ""Nacho"" Gonzalez, was captured and another 12 alleged members of the Mazatlecos were killed in July 2014, among them some high-level members of the structure, in an operation aimed at Chapo Isidro's capture.The US designation demonstrated an increased international awareness of Chapo's activities and indicated that his influence was growing, and Mexican authorities appear to have trained their eye on him as well. While it remains unclear whether the Meza Flores network can truly be considered a DTO in its own right or if he heads a faction of the BLO network, now that Chapo Guzman has been captured Chapo Isidro's group could be well-positioned to seize more power and territory in Mexico's drug trafficking heartland of Sinaloa.","Chapo Isidro is allegedly involved in transnational drug trafficking to the US, as well as power struggles for local drug ""plazas."" He is also thought to work as the muscle behind the BLO in Sinaloa state.","Chapo's main area of influence is northern Sinaloa state, though there are reports he has a presence in Baja California Sur.",Chapo Isidro's most notable enemy is the Sinaloa Cartel. His main ally is the BLO.,"With the BLO weakened and plagued by infighting and external rivalries, events such as the US designation of Chapo Isidro's group as a DTO and the capture of Chapo Guzman could mean his influence is growing and that he could be poised to strike out on his own or take control of at least part of the BLO network. However, an increased public profile has come with increased attentions from the security forces, and it may become increasingly difficult for Chapo Isidro to operate freely."
"Marcos de Jesus Figueroa Garcia, alias 'Marquitos'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/marcos-de-jesus-figueroa-garcia-alias-marquitos/,Marcos de Jesus Figueroa Garcia,Marquitos,./images/individuals/marcos-de-jesus-figueroa-garcia.jpg,2016-11-17,"['colombia', 'colombia personalities', 'gaitanistas']",colombia,"Marcos de Jesus Figueroa Garcia, alias ""Marquitos,"" is a powerful underworld figure in Colombia's northeast provinces of La Guajira and Cesar, whose reach extends deep into the region's political establishment. He built his criminal network around smuggling drugs and contraband gasoline between Venezuela and Colombia, and formed a criminal-political axis with La Guajira's corrupt former Governor Juan Francisco ""Kiko"" Gomez, which was allegedly behind a series of political murders. Figueroa was captured in October 2014.","Born into a poor family of Wayuu indigenous ancestry, Figueroa grew up in the La Guajira municipality of Barrancas, where he earned the nickname ""Marquitos"" (""Little Marcos"") due to his small stature. By the early 1990s, Marquitos had established a criminal sphere of influence in cross-border illegal activities such as contraband smuggling. In the mid-1990s he was arrested and imprisoned in Santa Marta but in 1998 he escaped alongside two other inmates in a plot involving a dump truck knocking down a section of the prison wall.Marquitos fled to Alta Guajira and began working for Jorge Gnecco Cerchar -- the leader of a powerful criminal-political clan, which has produced a governors and senators and whose influence continues today.Gnecco Cerchar had established a working relationship with paramilitary commander Hernan Giraldo in the mid-90s, and he began participating in drug trafficking. This arrangement was shaken by the incursion of the Northern Bloc of Colombia's largest paramilitary group at the time, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC), led by Rodrigo Tovar, alias ""Jorge 40."" When war broke out between Giraldo and Jorge 40, the latter came out victorious and in 2001 Jorge 40 had Gnecco Cerchar murdered.Throughout this time, Figueroa's influence grew, as he developed an intimate knowledge of the smuggling routes and players involved in contraband gasoline and drug trafficking through the region. Following Jorge 40's assassination of Gnecco Cerchar and several more of Marquitos' underworld allies, Marquitos fled to Venezuela to avoid the same fate.There he established a formidable criminal setup, which included smuggling contraband fuel and establishing a cooperative of low and mid-ranking drug exporters that stockpiling cocaine and, according to local rumor, sending it into Venezuela hidden in gasoline tanks, which then returned full of cash and contraband gasoline.After the demobilization of Jorge 40 and the paramilitaries, Marquitos returned to Colombia, where he began providing financial and armed backing to corrupt politicians, and operated as the armed wing of Kiko Gomez's political bloc as it took power in municipalities around the region. Figueroa stands accused of helping Gomez's expansion by murdering several opponents.After Gomez's arrest shone a spotlight on Figueroa's organization, the net began to close. In February 2014, Figueroa was convicted in absentia by a Bogota court of a triple homicide that took place in La Guajira in 2011. Later that month he was added to the Colombian National Police's ""most wanted list,"" with a $150,000 reward offered for information leading to his capture. Police began making inroads to his organization with a series of arrests of key figures, until finally they captured Figueroa himself in Brazil in October 2014.","Figueroa was a major player in the regional drug trade but his real power came from his control over the contraband gasoline trade. As well as smuggling his own gas, Figueroa also controlled main smuggling routes and sales points and anyone involved in the trade had to pay his ""quota."" He is also implicated in a string of political assassinations.",Figueroa's main areas of operations are his native state La Guajira and neighboring Cesar in the north eastern Colombian border region. He often used Venezuela as a refuge and was hiding out in Brazil when captured.,"Former La Guajira governor Juan Francisco ""Kiko"" Gomez, now imprisoned on murder charges, was long a key ally of Figueroa, and his political influence is believed to extend throughout the region. Figueroa is also thought to work have been working with the Urabeños criminal organization in La Guajira, although the extent of their collaboration remains unclear..","Figueroa was arrested in October 2014, leaving his criminal-political network facing an uncertain future."
"Victor Navarro, alias 'Megateo'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/megateo-epl/,Victor Navarro,Megateo,./images/individuals/victor-navarro.jpg,2016-11-17,"['colombia', 'colombia personalities', 'epl', 'megateo']",colombia,"Victor Ramon Navarro Serrano, alias ""Megateo,"" led the only remaining faction of the EPL guerrilla movement. Megateo was considered the most important drug trafficker in Norte de Santander, had a $1 million price on his head from the Colombian government, and was wanted by US authorities on international drug trafficking charges. In August 2015, reports emerged that he was killed during a military operation. Forensic pathologists identified his remains through DNA analysis in October of that same year.","Megateo was the leader of the ""Libardo Mora Toro"" Front, the only remaining unit of Maoist guerrilla group the Popular Liberation Army (EPL), and part of a faction that failed to demobilize in 1991 following the signing of a peace agreement with the Colombian government. Megateo was 15 at the time of demobilization, was barely literate, and still lived in his hometown San Calixto in Colombia's Norte de Santander department. Like many young men in the region at the time, he participated in urban militias that trained members as guerrillas and provided logistical and intelligence support to the EPL.When the EPL first disbanded, the dissident faction was led by Francisco Caraballo until he was arrested, along with his second in command, in 1994. The Libardo Mora Toro Front was one of just four fronts that continued to register activity in the year after Caraballo's capture. The remaining EPL members continued to suffer setbacks during the 1990s and were forced to retreat to the area around Megateo's hometown.Megateo reportedly became one of the principal leaders of the EPL remnants in the late 90s or early 2000s, around the same time paramilitary incursions and coca fumigations forced regional coca growers to relocate to the Ocaña area of Norte de Santander, near San Calixto. This led to the development of new cocaine trafficking routes, principally from Ocaña to the city of Aguachica to the Caribbean Coast, or Ocaña to the city of Cucuta to Venezuela.  Megateo and his group were able to gain control over a portion of the trade.The Norte de Santander drug kingpin became a prime target of Colombian authorities after April 2006, when EPL members ambushed and killed 10 members of the Department of Administrative Security (DAS) and seven soldiers sent to conduct an operation against the group in Hacari, Norte de Santander. The EPL has continued to engage with security forces -- near the end of 2010, they killed five police and injured a dozen others, and in June 2011, the group clashed with police in San Calixto. Colombian authorities offered a $1 million reward for Megateo's capture and, despite the small size of his army compared to both the FARC and the ELN, point to him as the main figure behind the conflict in the region.Megateo's faction has an estimated 50 members and controls much of the cocaine moving through the Catatumbo region in Norte de Santander. He works with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN), who also have a strong presence in the region, supplying coca base and cocaine to criminal groups including the Rastrojos. The EPL is also believed to have excellent intelligence capabilities. This collaborative relationship was evidenced by the discovery of 44 cocaine laboratories in Norte de Santander in April 2013, which police said were run by the FARC and the ELN, who then sold the processed cocaine to Megateo for distribution.DAS officials believe that Megateo owned large tracts of land in Catatumbo that are the site of laboratories producing up to two tons of cocaine per month, with a support network in Cucuta that facilitates the transportation of cocaine to Venezuela. In a July 2013 interview with Semana, Megateo admitted to charging a ""war tax"" of around $200 per kilo on cocaine deals in the region. US authorities have said that Megateo also supplied cocaine to Canada and the Dominican Republic.The EPL remnants suffered several blows in recent years, including the 2009 arrest of 21 EPL guerrillas, the arrest of Megateo's girlfriend in June 2012, and the arrest of 14 EPL members on international drug trafficking charges in September 2012. Megateo, however, continued to elude capture, with the exception of one brief incident in July 2008, when two of his confidantes drugged him and turned him in to DAS agents. It is not clear what happened next, although in the Semana interview, Megateo alleged that he escaped due to ""negligence"" on the part of his captors.Megateo enjoyed a great deal of local popular support and influence. According to Semana, which has referred to him as a ""Robin Hood with drug trafficking money,"" Megateo was known to give out school supplies and Christmas presents to locals. He also received assistance from corrupt officials -- by Semana's account, Megateo was informed of the 2006 DAS operation against him by DAS agents themselves.","Megateo was principally involved in cocaine trafficking and cocaine brokering, as head of the sole remaining EPL faction.","Megateo operated in the Norte de Santander department, mainly in the Catatumbo region.","The EPL reportedly works with the FARC and ELN, and supplies criminal groups such as the Rastrojos.","The EPL is thought to control a great deal of the cocaine exiting Colombia through the Norte de Santander department, and its influence could continue to grow. Though the group is small in numbers, it appears to have a wide network of influence and connections, and Megateo enjoyed a great deal of regional support."

He consolidated his hold on the organization in January 2013, after several bloody battles with rivals within his organization and with the Gulf Cartel's chief rivals, the Zetas, but was captured in August 2013.","Ramirez, according to the little open source data available, is a former investigative police officer who became a drug addict and a collaborator of the Gulf Cartel, not necessarily in that order. Following a time in rehab, he emerged as one of the top leaders of the Rojos, one of the several armed factions the Gulf Cartel developed beginning in the late 1990s.The other armed wings of the cartel, namely the Zetas and the Metros, carved their own spaces within what was essentially a large federation of groups that eventually stretched south to Guerrero and Quintana Roo, and west to Coahuila.The Rojos were originally assigned to Reynosa; the Metros to Matamoros; the Zetas to Nuevo Laredo. With the 2003 arrest and later extradition of the cartel's boss, Osiel Cardenas, these groups split into factions and began a prolonged fight for control of this lucrative corridor, which still sees hundreds of tons of cocaine, marijuana and synthetic drugs pass through its border crossings.The Zetas officially broke away in 2010. The Metros, who were loyal to Cardenas and his brother, Antonio Ezequiel ""Tony Tormenta"" Cardenas -- who himself was killed in a shootout with authorities in December 2010 -- and the Rojos, who were loyal to now jailed former Gulf Cartel boss Eduardo Costilla, alias ""El Coss,"" also split in September 2011, according to court testimony collected by the Brownsville Herald.The realignments went further and speak to the chaotic nature of the Mexican underworld. Some members of the Rojos allegedly joined the Zetas, as the various groups struggled to contain their internecine battles. The Rojos, and their leader X20, also aligned with the Sinaloa Cartel and displaced the Zetas from several key plazas, including Monterrey, the all-important industrial and money hub of northern Mexico.The fighting between these various factions came to a head in 2012 and the beginning of 2013. Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo saw some of the worst violence in their history, to cite just two Tamaulipas cities that came under siege.However, after the death of Hector Salgado, alias ""Metro 4,"" the head of the Metros in January 2013, and the capture of Miguel Angel Treviño, alias Z40, the leader of the Zetas, in July 2013, X20 became positioned to consolidate his hold on northeast Mexico.But his time at the helm was short-lived. He was captured by the Mexican army in Tamaulipas in August 2013.Now the question is whether his former armed wing, known as the Deltas, can take control. They may have some formidable competition in the Sinaloa Cartel, which had already been distancing itself as the Gulf Cartel infighting has grown worse and may seek to make its own play on the region.","X20 has been accused of trafficking large quantities of cocaine and marijuana. In 2010, he and others from the so-called ""Company"" were also named to the United States Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) ""Kingpin's List,"" which identifies him a high-level lieutenant of the Gulf Cartel who launders illicit funds.","Ramirez operated mainly from Reynosa, Tamaulipas, his base of operations for at least the past decade.","For the past several years, X20's Gulf Cartel worked closely with the Sinaloa Cartel, although there are some reports that say the two groups are now at odds.Ramirez's chief enemy was Alejandro ""Omar"" Treviño, alias ""Z42,"" the presumed successor to Miguel Treviño, alias ""Z40,"" the captured head of the Zetas.",Ramirez is jailed in Mexico but is wanted in the United States for organized crime and drug trafficking. He is named in a lengthy indictment issued in the District of Columbia in which the historic names of the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas are identified as co-conspirators (see indictment below) and may face extradition to the United States.

Z42 was considered the natural successor to his brother before his own capture in March 2015 in Nuevo Leon. He operated in Tamaulipas, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon.","Treviño was born in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas, and became involved in car theft and extortion schemes alongside his brothers at an early age. Various Treviño siblings later joined a group of military-trained enforcers who worked for the Gulf Cartel, known as the Zetas. These mercenaries would later break away in 2010.While working under the Gulf Cartel, Z42 was active primarily in Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas. He continued to work very closely with Z40 throughout this time period. According to one US agent, he once boasted that he had killed over 1,000 people.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) offers a $5 million reward in exchange for information leading to his capture. Other rival criminal organizations also offered a reward for Z42's death via narco-banners. In June 2013, for example, banners signed in the name of a Zeta splinter group known as the ""Legionaires"" appeared in cities across Tamaulipas, offering $1 million in exchange for intelligence about Z42's location.In March 2015, Omar was captured by Mexican security forces in Nuevo Leon.Z42 is wanted for numerous crimes in Mexico and the United States, including a case handled by the Western District of Texas, accusing Miguel, Omar, and their brother, Jose, of using front companies in Texas, New Mexico, and Oklahoma to launder profits on behalf of the Zetas. The case, filed in 2012, involved the use of US-based horse breeding companies in order to disguise dirty money. They were found guilty in April and are awaiting sentencing.Omar was also the head of the organization's activities in San Fernando when hundreds of migrants, most of them from Central America, were kidnapped and killed between 2010 - and 2012.In 2021, a new Netflix series, “Somos.,” (We Are), shed light on the 2011 Allende massacre in Coahuila, which killed up to 300 people, and was reportedly ordered by Z42 and his brother, Miguel Angel Treviño, alias ""Z40.""","Z42 participated in kidnappings, homicides, and drug trafficking on behalf of the Zetas. Narco-banners signed in his name have also appeared across Mexico, including several in Coahuila that threatened the editor of local newspaper Zocalo in 2013.","In the past, Z42 operated in Coahuila, although Nuevo Laredo is the traditional stronghold of the Treviño family and he operated in Nuevo Leon as well.","The Zetas' biggest enemies as of 2013 include the Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels, as well as smaller, splinter criminal organizations, such as the Knights Templar.","Many analysts pointed to Z42 as a possible inheritor of the Zetas, after Z40's arrest in July 2013. However, Omar's capture in March 2015 has placed both brothers in Mexican prison cells. Before his arrest, Omar faced significant challenges in holding the group together, not least because he was not seen as a capable, intelligent and strong leader. Prior to his brother's capture, the Zetas faced internal squabbling as some mid-level commanders accused Miguel Treviño of betraying his compatriots to the US."

He is the leader of the MS13 ""program"" known as the ""Normandie Locos Salvatruchos,"" or simply ""La Normandy,"" which runs ""cliques,"" or cells, along El Salvador's western Pacific coast, and is believed to control drug distribution in the departments of Santa Ana, Ahuachapán, and Sonsonate.","Barney's criminal history includes various arrests between 2002 and 2007 for crimes including aggravated homicide and extortion. In September 2009, he was caught with seven kilograms of cocaine in the department of La Libertad, south of the capital San Salvador -- a large amount of drugs for an MS13 member. However, he was later released on a technicality and the decision was upheld, a move criticized by Security Minister Manuel Melgar as an indication that judges favor ""mareros,"" as members of the MS13 and Barrio 18 gangs are known locally. According to police intelligence, Barney paid off several judges to secure his release.Police have also linked Barney to a US-bound shipment of 113 kilograms of cocaine valued at $2,825,000 intercepted on a boat off Zuncita beach in Sonsonate on November 7, 2012.Barney has been accused of involvement in 50 homicides, in some of which the bodies were cut up, disposed of in plastic garbage bags, and thrown along public highways, according to investigative news outlet El Faro.Barney's financial activities follow patterns typical of money launderers. By 2008, he owned at least 14 properties used for various purposes. He is also one of the owners of a bus company called Ruta 42-B which operates in Santa Tecla, La Libertad (near the capital San Salvador), which according to police has ties to the Grand Alliance for National Unity (Gran Alianza por la Unidad Nacional - GANA) political party. Police intelligence indicates that the party has provided a political and legal safe haven to Barney and was part of the team that pressured the local judges to drop the 2009 drug charges.In June 2013, Barney was added to the US Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals subject to economic sanctions, along with five other MS13 leaders.What sets Barney apart from other MS13 leaders is his level of influence. It is not common for MS13 members to be transporters of drugs in their own right, particularly not on a transnational level. Barney, however, is thought to possibly move drugs to Guatemala from his area of control near the border.His power is thought to stem in part from his father's connections. Former Salvadoran army colonel Asmel Antonio Bercián Rivera, alias ""El Tiburón,"" is allegedly linked to some of El Salvador's most powerful criminals. He has been linked to Salvadoran drug trafficking organization the Texis Cartel. According to police, he owns hardware stores used as cover for moving cocaine, and uses gang members to do the grunt work.Barney's international reach remained largely unconfirmed until May 2018, when his father and brother were arrested following an investigation that tracked biweekly cocaine shipments from Colombia, Panama and Costa Rica.","Barney and his program are involved in drug transportation and distribution, possibly at a transnational level. Other crimes attributed to him include murder and possibly money laundering. ","Barney operates in the departments of Santa Ana, Ahuachapán and Sonsonate, where he controls drug distribution, possibly moving cocaine to Guatemala.","Likely allies include the Texis Cartel and the Zetas, while a major enemy of the MS13 is the Barrio 18 street gang.Barney also appears to have some allies in the Salvadorian government, although it remains unclear how many there are. In January 2020, former National Assembly President Sigfrido Reyes was accused of laundering money for members of Barney's family.","Barney was most likely only able to establish a transnational drug trafficking network thanks to his father's connections. However, his father's arrest in 2018 -- and subsequent death from medical complications -- don't appear to have slowed down Barney's activities. His apparent success could have serious implications for future operations of the MS13, as he is an example of how gang members can successfully make the leap into more sophisticated criminal operations.

"Antônio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, alias 'Nem'",https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/antonio-francisco-bonfim-lopes-nem/,Antônio Francisco Bonfim Lopes,Nem,./images/individuals/antônio-francisco-bonfim-lopes.jpg,2022-07-18,"['amigos dos amigos', 'brazil', 'brazil personalities']",brazil,"Antônio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, alias “Nem,” led the Amigos dos Amigos gang in Rocinha, a neighborhood of some 150,000 residents in the southern part of Rio de Janeiro that is a key drug trafficking area. The crime boss, often touted as Rio’s most intelligent and sophisticated, was arrested in November 2011 while attempting to flee the neighborhood ahead of a planned security force occupation. Nem is thought to have continued running Amigos dos Amigos’ criminal activities from inside prison, but dissidence within the ranks of the group and violent clashes with rivals may be weakening his control.","Nem was born in Rocinha to parents who had migrated from northeast Brazil in an attempt to escape poverty. According to Nem, medical debts that amassed when his daughter developed a tumor in 1999 led him on the path from supervisor of a cable TV company to head of Amigos dos Amigos’ operations in the favela before the age of 30. Nem borrowed money from the powerful Rio-based Red Command (Comando Vermelho), and in exchange put his managerial experience to work for the group’s Rocinha drug boss, Luciano Barbosa da Silva, alias “Lulu,” until police killed him in 2004.In 2018, Nem told news outlet El País that after Lulu’s death he attempted to leave drug trafficking behind, but corrupt police officers threatened and pressured him to continue his involvement in criminal activities in order to maintain stability in the favela and a steady flow of money to corrupt security forces.During the tumultuous time that followed Lulu's death, Amigos dos Amigos, a criminal group formed by dissident former members of the dominant Red Command, took control of Rocinha. Amigos dos Amigos boss Erismar Rodrigues Moreira, alias “Bem-Te-Vi,” ran operations in the favela until his death in a shootout with police in 2005. Nem and another close associate of Bem-Te-Vi, João Rafael da Silva, alias ""Joca,"" then took the reins from the slain gang boss.In 2007, Joca was arrested, opening the door for Nem to become the top leader of Amigos dos Amigos. Under Nem’s leadership, the gang opted less for violence as a means of control and more for building community support and buying off corrupt police. The reduction in violence was good for business and attracted less negative attention to Rocinha, helping to turn it into one of the most lucrative drug markets in the city. Sales of cocaine and marijuana in Rocinha and neighboring Vidigal are estimated to have brought in yearly profits of more than 100 million reais ($60 million) during Nem’s reign.Nem functioned as an old-style mafia boss, wielding total power within Rocinha, with the backing of a personal army of some 200 gunmen and a makeshift social welfare system that provided services to residents. An interview he gave to a reporter shortly before his 2011 arrest painted a picture of a man who exerted relatively benign social control in his community, adjudicating disputes between residents. He claimed that there was hardly any theft within the neighborhood, that he did not allow the sale of crack cocaine there, and that he supported some policing initiatives. Nem has since denounced combative militarized approaches to addressing violence in Rocinha and has suggested that long-term programs focused on education and healthcare, as well as drug legalization, would be more effective at taking down traffickers.Nem attempted to fake his own death in January 2010 in order to retire and evade capture. He had a death certificate made up, and a fake identity prepared, but the scheme was discovered before he could carry it out.In August 2010, Nem made national headlines when a group of his men invaded the Intercontinental Hotel in the neighborhood of São Conrado after fleeing from a police ambush on their way back from a party. The gunmen took dozens of people hostage in the hotel, distracting authorities and allowing Nem to safely return to Rocinha.Nem was arrested in November 2011 ahead of a publicly announced security force occupation of Rocinha. According to journalist Misha Glenny’s 2015 biography of Nem, the drug boss had previously attempted unsuccessfully to negotiate his surrender to authorities, and his widely televised arrest while attempting to flee Rocinha in the trunk of a diplomatic vehicle was likely engineered by police based on surveillance.Nem was sentenced in 2013 to a total of nearly 100 years in prison for drug trafficking, racketeering and money laundering. He is currently being held at a maximum-security federal prison in the rural northern state of Rondônia.Nem's criminal career became so well-known in Rio that a book has been written about his life, with a television show also in development. ","Nem and his Amigos dos Amigos group made the majority of their criminal proceeds from sales of cocaine and marijuana in Rocinha, the neighboring favela of Vidigal and middle-class neighborhoods in southern Rio. They laundered the profits through local businesses. Nem also oversaw violent crimes committed by Amigos dos Amigos members, reportedly including torturing and murdering individuals perceived as threats to the gang.",Nem’s base of criminal operations throughout his time as the boss of Amigos dos Amigos was the neighborhood of Rocinha in southern Rio de Janeiro.,"Amigos dos Amigos’ main enemy is Rio de Janeiro’s other biggest drug gang, the Red Command.Nem’s former bodyguard, Rogério Avelino da Silva, alias “Rogério 157,” is thought to have broken from the ranks of Amigos dos Amigos before his December 2017 arrest, partnering with the rival Red Command in an attempt to take over Rocinha's lucrative drug trade.According to security experts consulted by InSight Crime in 2017, Amigos dos Amigos may have recently teamed up with Brazil's strongest crime group, the São Paulo-based First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC), which is reportedly trying to weaken the control of the Red Command in Rio. Press reports based on official sources suggest Nem may also have partnered with the Pure Third Command (Terceiro Comando Puro) to form a new group called the Third Command of Friends (Terceiro Comando dos Amigos).","Following Nem’s 2011 arrest, news reports have indicated that the drug boss could be maintaining some level of control over Amigos dos Amigos’ operations from inside prison. In 2014, Nem’s girlfriend Danúbia de Souza Rangel was accused of helping relay orders from Nem to Amigos dos Amigos members in Rocinha. (Rangel, who hid out in Rocinha as a fugitive until she was allegedly expelled by Rogério 157, was arrested in October 2017.)Being behind bars often does not prove to be an obstacle for Brazilian gangsters wishing to continue their criminal careers, making it likely that Nem continues to maintain control of Amigos dos Amigos. However, Nem himself has denied this, and conflicts in Rocinha sparked by dissidence in the group may weaken whatever power he has within the gang."

Walid Makled,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/walid-makled/,Walid Makled,,./images/individuals/walid-makled.jpg,2021-09-21,"['venezuela', 'venezuela personalities', 'walid makled']",venezuela,"Once the most powerful civilian drug trafficker in Venezuela, Syrian-born Venezuelan citizen Walid Makled, otherwise known as “El Turco” or “El Arabe,” managed cocaine shipments that left the country by sea and air, going to Central America and Europe.Rather than running a traditional drug trafficking organization with an armed wing, Makled acted primarily as a broker, selling his services to the highest bidder, from corrupt elements in Venezuela's military -- known as the Cartel of the Suns (Cartel de los Soles) -- to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC). In exchange, Makled promised safe passage of cocaine shipments, which left Venezuela by the ton.He also counted on the support of certain governors from the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela – PSUV) and officials from the administration of former President Hugo Chávez.","Walid is a member of one of Venezuela's most notorious business families, the Makleds, who started out running supermarket and retail appliance businesses. Between 2000 and 2008, the family's business holdings grew to include the warehouses and loading docks at the country's biggest port, Puerto Cabello, and Aeropostal, formerly the second-largest airline in the country. The family even held the rights to control Venezuela's trade in urea, a fertilizer that may be used as a precursor for making bombs and that traditionally can only be traded with special military permits. The family business grew especially rapidly between 2004 and 2008, according to a Public Ministry probe into their suspicious banking transactions.Even at the earliest stages of Makled's career, his criminal activities were apparently facilitated by the complicity of the security forces and government officials. His first criminal enterprise was robbing and hijacking trucks. He has said that at one point he controlled a group of 300 armed men who stole 30 trucks a week, under the protection of Venezuela's National Guard. He reportedly first appeared on the radar of US anti-drug authorities in 2004, when the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) raided a Makled-owned warehouse for urea and drug precursor chemicals that were suspected of being diverted to illicit ends. But after then-President Hugo Chavez ended formal cooperation with the DEA in 2005, the case was closed.As the Makled family businesses continued to grow, so did Walid's ability to transport tons of cocaine across the hemisphere. Some 5.5 tons of cocaine seized in 2006 from a DC-9 jet plane in Ciudad del Carmen, Mexico, was traced back to Caracas and is believed to have been part of an operation organized by Makled. The cocaine shipment was reportedly purchased from the FARC and was meant for the Sinaloa Cartel. This cargo departed from the presidential runway at the Simón Bolívar International Airport, Venezuela's largest. At the height of Makled's business, he was reportedly smuggling up to 10 tons of cocaine per month.The beginning of Makled's decline came in 2008, when his younger brother Abdala ran for mayor of Venezuela's third largest city, Valencia, the capital of Carabobo state. Abdala campaigned as a pro-Chavez independent. While he still claimed loyalty to the Chavez regime, his candidacy was seen as eating away at support for the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unida de Venezuela - PSUV) in Carabobo. In 2008, Walid’s brother Abdalá was sentenced to 12 years in prison for drug trafficking after being found on one of Walid’s properties with 400 kilograms of cocaine. He was freed in December 2020. Two other brothers, Alex and Basel, were released in May 2021.This political battle is believed to have prompted the government's first serious effort to crack down on the Makleds' operations. On November 13, 2008, security forces raided a Makled family property, where they reportedly seized 392 kilos of cocaine. Three brothers were arrested, although Walid Makled went underground and only came into public view once more when he was arrested in the Colombian border town of Cucuta in 2010. Sources consulted by InSight Crime suggested that the military planted the cocaine on the Makled farm in order to frame them.After his arrest, Makled went public with allegations about the Venezuelan establishment, stating, ""All my business associates are generals."" He also claimed to have financed one of Chavez's presidential campaigns in exchange for concessions at Puerto Cabello.When Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos' administration agreed to extradite Makled to Venezuela instead of the United States, arguing that he was wanted in Venezuela on murder charges, as opposed to the United States where he is only wanted on drug charges, it was widely viewed as part of an effort to persuade Venezuela to crack down on the FARC guerrillas living inside the country.","Though he began with truck hijacking, Makled rapidly rose to the status of major drug kingpin by facilitating many international drug shipments. Initially, Makled is believed to have leveraged his family businesses -- especially the family-owned warehouses and fleet of vehicles in Puerto Cabello -- to provide transport services for drug traffickers. As the businesses grew, Makled established his own drug trafficking network using family-owned airstrips in Venezuela and moving the illicit cargo through Central America and Mexico. A US indictment against Makled filed in September 2010 alleges that the Venezuelan coordinated several flights carrying multi-ton shipments of cocaine destined for the United States and Europe between 2006 and 2009.Makled’s trial in Caracas featured over 900 pages of accusations, highlighting the extent of his alleged criminal activities.In 2015, the drug kingpin was sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison, his brother Abdalá was sent down for six years and six months for concealing firearms, and two other brothers, Basel and Alex, were sentenced to eight years for money laundering. Abdalá was released in December 2020, and Alex and Basel followed in May 2021.Walid had also been accused of two murders -- one of a journalist and another of a veterinarian -- as well as illicit association and possession of illegal arms, though he was cleared of those charges.This decision was appealed by the Attorney General's Office, which also opened an investigation into whether the judge who cleared Makled of the two homicides, Alí Fabricio Paredes, had favored him. Paredes eventually lost his job and was jailed for a short time. On further appeal, Makled's prison sentence was increased from 14 to 21 years.","Makled’s operations were primarily based in Venezuela, particularly Puerto Cabello. As his empire expanded, however, he established a drug trafficking network extending through Central America, namely Honduras and Mexico, which were the connecting points to transfer drugs ultimately to the United States and Europe.","Makled has publicly claimed that his trafficking network was made possible by complicity at the very highest levels of Venezuela's military and government. ""All my business associates are generals,"" he once famously claimed. Makled has also said that he paid off several members of Venezuela’s National Assembly and that he funded PSUV political campaigns. Makled also carried a credential signed by former Supreme Court magistrate Eladio Aponte, which has been interpreted as proof of Makled's influence over Venezuela's highest court.Evidence of his continuing influence has been seen in the benefits he has received while in prison, such as being taken to Caracas' Military Hospital to receive medical treatment.In March 2018, Makled issued a threat to retired general Clíver Alcalá Cordones who maintained a long-term feud with the drug kingpin while still active. Despite supposedly being in prison, El Turco published a video threatening Alcalá, on his personal Instagram account. Remarkably, he was not dressed in prison clothes and appeared to be seated on a sofa.Makled is also alleged to have maintained ties with Colombia’s FARC, providing the guerrilla group with weapons in exchange for cocaine. Makled has also said he has knowledge about the activities of the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah in Latin America.While doubts long surrounded these allegations, in February 2019, former Venezuelan intelligence chief Hugo Carvajal Barrios told the New York Times of links between Hezbollah and former vice-president Tareck El Aissami. He added that El Aissami and Interior Minister Nestor Reverol had been bribed to ignore Makled's activities.According to Carvajal, in 2012 when his team was investigating Makled, they seized a shipment of 400 kilograms of cocaine on a small plane. After the seizure, he said he received pressure from the government to return the drugs to Makled.In 2016, Makled accused Reverol of having seized his assets and $140 million in profits from drug trafficking, which the minister has denied.","Makled's trial in Venezuela began in April 2012, amid speculation that his decision not to testify publicly meant he had come to some kind of agreement with the government in return for not identifying Venezuelan officials complicit in illicit activities. On February 10, 2015, he was sentenced to 14 years and six months in prison for drug trafficking and money laundering, but was absolved of weapons, organized crime, and murder charges. In response, Venezuela's Attorney General's Office vowed to appeal the court's decision, and officials promptly arrested the judge who had sentenced Makled for alleged favoritism. In an August 2016 decision, a Caracas appeals court raised Makled’s sentence to 21 years and six months.The Makled empire has deteriorated significantly since Walid’s arrest in 2008. Three of Makled's siblings were also sentenced after their arrest in 2008; two for money laundering and one for weapons concealment. Given his lengthy prison sentence, the US charges against him and the fact that he has publicly named many suspected former members of his network, it seems extremely unlikely that Makled will ever make a comeback in the drug trade.Despite his brothers’ liberation, Walid Makled continues to be detained inside the infamous Helicoide Prison in Caracas."

When a conflict broke out between the Galeano brothers and Escobar in 1992 over allegations of theft, Escobar had them assassinated.Don Berna decided to seek vengeance. Along with paramilitary leaders Fidel and Carlos Castaño, he created the People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar (PEPES). A combination of criminal forces, the PEPES united rural paramilitaries, the Cali Cartel and corrupt elements of the Colombian National Police in an effort to take down Escobar once and for all. The PEPES were instrumental in the police's work to track down and kill the kingpin in December 1993.With Escobar out of the picture, Don Berna began taking over the drug trafficking enterprise he had left behind in Medellin. He deepened his ties to paramilitary organizations, and eventually headed several blocs of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), including the Medellin-based Cacique Nutibara Bloc.Don Berna also established control over local street gangs in the city, known as ""combos,"" forcing them to hand over a percentage of their profits in exchange for being allowed to extort, rob and sell drugs. He created a fearsome hit squad known as La Terraza, which played a part in ridding Medellin of guerrilla presence.In 2005, Don Berna participated in the demobilization of the AUC, turning himself in to authorities. Soon after, however, he was imprisoned on charges that he had broken the terms of his demobilization. Don Berna directed his group to reduce violence levels, causing homicides in Medellin to plummet. This peace became known as ""Donbernabilidad,"" a cynical reference to the Spanish word for ""governability."" The calm ended in 2008, however, when he was extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges.",Don Berna made his money primarily from cocaine trafficking and taxing local street gangs. He also ran a hit squad known as La Terraza.,"Don Berna is from the city of Tulua in Valle del Cauca province, but his power base was in Medellin, Antioquia.","Don Berna was known as a cold, calculating criminal who never made permanent alliances. He personally ordered the deaths of several one-time allies, including La Terraza heads who challenged his authority, and other AUC leaders. He was among those who plotted to kill AUC founder Carlos Castaño, a former ally, and likely ordered the death of rival AUC lieutenant Carlos Mauricio Garcia Fernandez, alias ""Doble Cero.""","In June 2008, Don Berna pleaded guilty in the Southern District Court of New York to ""conspiring to import multi-ton quantities of cocaine into the United States,"" and was sentenced to 31 years in prison. Since then the Oficina has been badly fractured and has lost much of its former standing."

Clayburn reportedly receives cocaine shipments from Colombia’s San Andres Island, then hands them off to Zeledon.Zeledon moves the drugs north along the Caribbean shoreline, using boats with secret compartments built into them. The boats are built in a shipyard run by Zeledon. He is reportedly paid for his services in cocaine, which he then sells to the local population.","Signs of Zeledon’s political influence became evident after he was arrested in May 2011 for causing a public disturbance, after he came to blows with a local pastor.

Zeledon was held for only 12 hours, and prisoners staged a riot in the jail where he was being held in what was interpreted as an expression of support for Zeledon.Two weeks after Zeledon's arrest, the Bluefields police chief was transferred back to Managua.

According to statements by former paramilitaries submitted under the Justice and Peace process, Mi Sangre moved from the Oficina to become one of the principal drug runners for the Centauros Bloc under Arroyave's direct command, and was instrumental in the creation of the AUC's Capital Bloc, an urban group operating in Bogota.Mi Sangre's involvement in the Capital Bloc was such that by 2001 he had not only set up an ""oficina de cobro"" in Bogota -- a localized, semi-autonomous criminal structure that controls debt collection, extortion rackets and offers assassination services -- but had come to control much of the drug trade in the capital under Arroyave's supervision. The position is said to have been handed to him directly by one of the AUC founders, Vicente Castaño.This enabled Mi Sangre to wield considerable influence in the criminal underworld and also to maintain high profile political alliances, as the AUC did in much of Colombia. The most notable of these was with Ciro Ramirez, a former senator who was sentenced in March 2011 as part of the ""parapolitics"" scandal.When the demobilization of the AUC began in 2003, with more than 30,000 paramilitaries surrendering, Mi Sangre took a role at the negotiating table in Santa Fe de Ralito as spokesperson for the Centauros Bloc. He demobilized in September 2005, claiming to be a mid-level fighter.Perhaps emboldened by the subsequent arrest of his superiors in the AUC, Mi Sangre continued to manage his operations in Bogota and attempted a push into Medellin in 2007, ordering the assassination of a member of the Oficina de Envigado. The move backfired, and Mi Sangre was forced to retreat and hide at the farm of now-extradited drug lord Juan Carlos Sierra, alias ""El Tuso,"" for fear of retaliation. He fled to Argentina, only returning in 2008 once the leader of the Oficina, Diego Fernando Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" had been extradited to the US.Like many demobilized paramilitaries, and fighters who never entered the process, Mi Sangre aligned himself with the Urabeños upon his return, moving to Uraba in 2009 to control some of the group's smuggling routes in the region. His choice of alliance is unsurprising in light of the identity of the group's leaders. Urabeños founder Daniel Rendon Herrera, alias ""Don Mario,"" controlled the finances of the Centauros Bloc during Mi Sangre's time. Dario Usuga -- who took over the Urabeños leadership together with his brother Juan de Dios when Rendon was captured in April 2009 -- had also been a fighter with the bloc during Mi Sangre's time.Mi Sangre's influence and notoriety grew considerably during his time with the Urabeños. In July 2011, officials from the Colombian judicial police (DIJIN), Interpol and the DEA, in a joint move named ""Operation Borders,"" captured 26 members of a transnational drug smuggling ring said to be under the control of Mi Sangre. The group, including five officials from Colombia's Civil Aviation Authority, were charged with moving up to 2,000 kg of cocaine a month via commercial flights from Bogota, Barranquilla, and the island of San Andres.Mi Sangre's importance in the group increased following the death of Urabeños leader Juan de Dios Usuga, alias ""Giovanni,"" in January 2012. He began to make significant inroads into Medellin, due to his role in facilitating ties between the Urabeños and Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias ""Valenciano,"" the now-captured leader of the Oficina de Envigado. The relationship between the two is said to have developed in either late 2010 or early 2011 with the aim of securing drug trafficking routes out of the city towards Uraba. Despite the alliance, however, Mi Sangre refrained from directly interfering in the internecine conflict that existed between Bonilla and his bitter rival and fellow Oficina member Eric Vargas Cardenas, alias ""Sebastian,"" (also now captured) for control of the city.Mi Sangre was able to reenter Medellin via the western neighbourhood of Belen, where he worked with a local gang by the name of the ""Chivos"" -- the goats -- and two criminals known by the aliases of ""Rey"" and ""Gelatina,"" the latter of whom Mi Sangre met in the Centauros Bloc. The authorities raised questions about Mi Sangre's sudden move into the city and alliance with Bonilla, stating that Mi Sangre's real aim was to usurp Bonilla and take over his routes for the Urabeños.In spite of Mi Sangre's criminal history, reputation -- Alvaro Uribe publicly called for his arrest in 2009 -- and growing presence in Medellin, Colombia's authorities had trouble gathering enough evidence against him for either prosecution or the issuance of an arrest warrant. Mi Sangre was apprehended in June 2010 in Antioquia's northern Bajo Cauca region but released due to lack of evidence. There was no arrest warrant issued against him until March 2012, despite his links to international drug trafficking operations and death threats against an El Espectador journalist, forcing her to leave Colombia.Following the removal of Bonilla, Mi Sangre's role as one of the premier drug lords in Medellin grew even further with reports that he took control of areas that were previously in the hands of Bonilla, including parts of Comuna 13, Belen, Aguas Frias and Altavista.Mi Sangre was arrested in Buenos Aires in October 2012, with Argentina's Secretary of Security, Sergio Berni, calling him ""the most important narco in the world,"" following his capture. After several years in an Argentine jail, Mi Sangre was extradited to the United States in November 2016. ","Given his long and colorful history, Mi Sangre has participated in a range of criminal activities, including drug trafficking, extortion, money laundering, and murder for hire.","While working for the Urabeños, Mi Sangre operated in the Uraba region of Colombia. He was also able to make inroads into the Antioquia region and Medellin.","As a leader of the Urabeños, Mi Sangre cultivated and maintained close relationships with other leaders of the criminal organization. He, however, made strong enemies in the Oficina de Envigado when he took steps to increase his power in Medellin.",

He would later lead paramilitary successor group the ERPAC, before surrendering to the government in 2011.","As a member of the AUC, Caracho met his future ally, Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero, alias ""Cuchillo,"" while both men were mid-level paramilitary commanders in the AUC. After Cuchillo killed AUC warlord Miguel Arroyave in 2004, Arroyave's army -- known as the Centauros Bloc -- split into two factions. Caracho joined one of these factions, which became known as the Heroes del Llano Bloc.Heroes del Llano officially demobilized in April 2006, and Caracho began working alongside Cuchillo, even though the bloc commander, Manuel de Jesus Piraban, alias ""Pirata,"" is thought to have been hostile to the ruthless Cuchillo. The bad feeling did not affect the relationship between the two fighters. When Cuchillo founded the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia (ERPAC), Caracho went with him.He soon became one of Cuchillo's most trusted men. Caracho is suspected of overseeing two assassination attempts -- July 2009 and March 2010 -- against ""Emerald Czar"" Victor Carranza, a sign of the confidence that the ERPAC leader had in him.After Cuchillo's death in a police raid in December 2010, Caracho inherited control of the ERPAC. He ran the group's operations while based in northern Guaviare or southern Meta, perhaps the municipality of Mapiripan, where Cuchillo was killed and where much of his land holdings were concentrated.In December 2011, Caracho negotiated the demobilization of some 272 ERPAC fighters, including himself. In 2013 he was sentenced to six years in prison.","As a member of ERPAC, Caracho reportedly oversaw several assassination attempts, and coordination drug shipments as well as extortion payments from farmers and small businesses.","Caracho reportedly spent part of his ERPAC career based in the eastern department of Vichada, coordinating drug shipments on behalf of Cuchillo's ally Daniel Barrera, alias ""El Loco."" He was also responsible for handling the extortion payments, or ""vacunas,"" paid by coca and palm oil farmers, ranchers and small-scale businesses in ERPAC strongholds like Mapiripan and San Martin.He took control of ERPAC's operations in northern Guaviare or southern Meta following Cuchillo's death.",,"Caracho is currently serving a six-year prison sentence after being convicted of drug trafficking, aggravated criminal activity, and explosives charges in 2013."

Of the three FARC leaders, Timochenko has the most mysterious past.","Some sources say Timochenko is a trained medical doctor, but there is no record of his studies. He hails from Quindío department in central Colombia’s coffee region, which saw some of the country’s worst political violence during a decades-long upheaval that began in the 1940s and ended just before groups like the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) emerged in the mid-1960s.Timochenko was trained in Cuba and Russia, and his nom de guerre was presumably chosen in honor of Semyon Timoshenko, a famous Soviet general during World War II. Before entering the guerrilla movement, Timochenko joined the Colombian Communist Party’s youth organization (Juventud Comunista Colombiana – JUCO). At the time, the JUCO opposed the administration of Alfonso López Michelsen. After taking up with the FARC, Timochenko rose through the ranks in some of the group’s most important strategic zones of influence. He is believed to have started his career with the FARC in the violence-torn province of Antioquia, before moving on to the Magdalena Medio region in central Colombia.After the FARC’s Eighth Conference in 1993, Colombia saw the guerrillas face tremendous pressure from the military and from paramilitary groups. Suspected guerrilla sympathizers were massacred by right-wing paramilitaries of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia – AUC). Gripped by paranoia, some local FARC commanders carried out brutal purges within their own ranks, until Timochenko stepped in and took command. This tale fed his reputation as a radical hardliner within the FARC, especially compared to past leaders such as Manuel Marulanda and Guillermo León Sáenz Vargas, alias “Alfonso Cano.”In 1986, Timochenko was named to the FARC Secretariat, the organization’s seven-member command unit, and one year later he was made head of the Eastern Bloc. However, Jorge Briceño, alias “Mono Jojoy,” overshadowed Timochenko in terms of military influence within the FARC following the assault on the Girasol military base on January 8, 1991 in the town of Mesetas, Meta department.After the Eighth FARC Conference in 1994, Timochenko was named commander of the Magdalena Medio Bloc, which was thought to be one of the toughest guerrilla divisions to command. Following the November 2011 death of Alfonso Cano, the guerrillas’ previous commander, Timochenko assumed leadership of the FARC.Timochenko was known in the guerrilla group for his military skills, and although he had some experience managing international contacts in Venezuela, he relied on Luciano Marín, alias “Iván Márquez,” for diplomatic and international relations, as the latter was head of the FARC’s International Front. Timochenko also reportedly gained experience heading up the rebels’ intelligence and counter-intelligence, which aids him in keeping an eye on his inner circle.Under his command, the FARC decided to officially begin peace negotiations with the government of then-President Juan Manuel Santos in Cuba on September 4, 2012, which in reality was more of a continuation of efforts Alfonso Cano had been making before he was killed. After two years of exploration and four in negotiation, on November 24, 2016, the peace agreement was signed, sealing a pact for the rebel group’s demobilization and its transformation into a political party with the same acronym but a different name: Common Alternative Revolutionary Force (Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Común – FARC).In September 2017, Timochenko was elected president of the new FARC political party, and shortly afterwards he announced his candidacy for president of Colombia. However, after he developed serious heart problems, the FARC withdrew its presidential bid asTimochenko recovered.Criminal ActivitiesInterpol issued a red notice for Timochenko, and more than 100 warrants have been issued for his arrest. Some of the crimes for which he has been accused are related to the 2001 kidnapping of former Meta Governor Alan Jara, the takeover of Vichada department’s capital city of Mitú in 1998 and the 2003 Club El Nogal bombing in Bogotá. Before the peace accords were signed, the US State Department was offering a reward of up to $5 million for information leading to Timochenko’s arrest to answer for drug trafficking charges, although the FARC affirmed that its participation, as a group, in drug trafficking was limited to taxing coca farmers.Once the peace agreement was signed, the United States lifted warrants for his arrest in Colombia.GeographyWhen he was commander of the FARC’s Eastern Bloc, Timochenko wielded a great deal of influence in the Eastern Plains, Cundinamarca, Boyacá and several places in the Colombian Amazon. He later took the helm of the Magdalena Medio Bloc in central Colombia. After that, it is believed he moved to an area in the northeast corner of the country, covering the Serranía del Perijá mountain range and its border with Venezuela. The region grew in importance for the rebels over the last 15 years for two reasons: the growth of the FARC as a drug trafficking organization, and the emergence of elements in Venezuela that acted as partners in both criminal and insurgent activities.","Historically, the main enemies of FARC leaders like Timochenko have included extreme right-wing elements of Colombia’s political elite, some of whom have had ties to paramilitary groups. However, the FARC has seen its share of infighting as well. A rift formed in its ruling body when Timochenko assumed leadership of the FARC because Iván Márquez was also a candidate for the guerrilla group’s top position. Although the FARC handover mechanism seemed to sufficiently address how the rebel group replaced its commanders, the succession of Alfonso Cano became a challenge.In the wake of successful military operations against its commanders, the FARC increasingly depended on young leaders due to its need to continue with the chain of command. This meant that even though Iván Márquez was a strong contender for the top leadership position, Timochenko took the reins because he had more years of service in the Secretariat under his belt.The division became most evident as the FARC transitioned into a political party. Márquez earned more votes than Timochenko in the new party’s elections for its national directorate after running on a more critical line regarding the implementation of the peace agreement. The political party’s decision-making process is now much more democratic, and this originally benefited his principle competitor for leadership within the movement: Márquez.When Márquez took up arms again in August 2019, flanked by numerous leaders of the ex-FARC Mafia, Timochenko got rid of the most radical threat to his power inside the party. However, two men were arrested in January 2020 near Timochenko’s home, having reportedly been sent to assassinate him. While initially, the assassination was linked to Hernán Darío Velásquez Saldarriaga, alias “El Paisa,” there are now heavy doubts about who was behind it. Regardless, it shows that Timochenko and by extension the FARC party may be seen as a threat by some of his former allies.","After leading the most important guerrilla group on the continent, orchestrating multiple acts of violence, committing extortion and participating in the drug trade, Timochenko was the main architect of the peace accords that paved the way for the FARC’s participation in Colombian politics by turning it into a political party on November 1, 2017.Timochenko is currently leading the new FARC political party and monitoring the implementation of the peace agreement. But it has been no easy task due to the party’s internal division and the many obstacles that have been put in the way of the peace process, such as the return to arms of former FARC leaders, Iván Marquez and Jesús Santrich.A failed assassination attempt in January 2020 has shown that resentment toward Timochenko for accepting the peace deal still festers.",,

He started out as a cardamom trader and used the experience and connections he made buying cardamom from local suppliers to move contraband. Eventually, Overdick moved to drug trafficking and transported large loads of cocaine from South America through Guatemala on the way to the United States. He also allegedly built clandestine runways and stored cocaine in Guatemalan warehouses.When the Zetas began to operate in Guatemala in 2007, Overdick allied himself with the brutal Mexican cartel to drive out a rival contraband family, the Leones, so that Overdick could control the highly strategic Zacapa corridor, a border state used for moving drug shipments.Thanks to his connections with military and political officials, Overdick did not have to keep a low profile. He attended public events with high-level public officials and even played on a local soccer team against the governor of Alta Verapaz.According to US and Guatemalan authorities, by the time he was captured Overdick had risen to become one of the top criminal leaders in Guatemala.",Overdick transported cocaine from South America through Guatemala en route to the United States. He was also involved in the contraband trade.,Overdick's base of operations was in the northern Guatemalan province of Alta Verapaz.,"Overdick teamed up with some of the largest Guatemalan drug traffickers, including Ottoniel Turcios, who was arrested in 2010 in Belize and extradited to the United States to face trial for drug trafficking. He also had close ties to the Lorenzana family, a long-time contraband family involved in drug trafficking.At the time of his capture, Overdick had an alliance with the Zetas. This alliance was convenient for both parties. The Overdick group benefited from the Zetas' firepower, training and brutal tactics that strike fear in their rivals. The Zetas benefited from Overdick's local connections in the political and business worlds, as well as his links with current and former Guatemalan military.","Guatemalan authorities reported that Overdick had been captured in San Lucas, west of Guatemala City, in April 2012.

Before his death, Luna built a considerable business empire in both the legal and criminal worlds and helped the Perrones become one of the most important criminal organizations in the Central American nation.","Chepe Luna, was a founding member of The Perrones, one of the first smuggling networks in El Salvador. The network was fostered in an environment of corruption and protection from the authorities, including the National Civil Police (PNC) and political parties. Chepe Luna held both Salvadoran and Honduran citizenship and was the owner of Transportes Ulua, a successful transport company headquarters in Tegucigalpa, Honduras.Like most of his compatriots at the top of the group, Luna got his start in the Salvadoran underworld bringing otherwise licit goods from across the Honduran border. Luna was known for moving dairy goods, which initially earned the Perrones the moniker ""Cartel de Los Quesos.""The logistical skills mastered while moving cheese came in handy when Luna and his colleagues decided to branch out into trafficking a more profitable good: cocaine. The Perrones have links with South American traffickers, who bring their merchandise up the Pacific coast from Colombia and Ecuador, usually in go-fast boats or semi-submersibles. From there, the drugs are offloaded onto Salvadoran vessels, from which they are brought to shore and moved northward to Guatemala along the Perrones' networks.Chepe quickly established himself as the most powerful drug smuggler in eastern El Salvador. He was able to exercise territorial control along critical junctures in the drug smuggling routes and established relationships with specific officials within the police and judicial systemLuna was long in the cross-hairs of national and international drug enforcement organizations, from the DEA and Interpol to El Salvador's National Police. Since 2004, he had an arrest warrant from the Southern District Court in the US hanging over his head, on drug trafficking and money laundering charges. He was arrested in El Salvador in 2002, after an altercation with police. At the time, the US singled him out as one of the foremost human traffickers in the country, yet Salvadoran authorities did not charge him with the crime, and he was later released.He was arrested in August 2012 in Honduras, where he was believed to be running the Perrones. However, he was released a day after his capture, with varied reports suggesting a lack of evidence, or that the arrest warrant had expired.In the end, it was not the police, but hitmen that caught up with Luna. He was killed in front of his transport company in Tegucigalpa by a group of at least eight gunmen. Afterward, the police managed to capture four of the men and killed two others. While Luna's murder has not yet been linked to any group, Luna's family says the killers were linked to gangs operating in Honduras.A source in El Salvador told Insight Crime that Luna's murder may have been the result of competition related to his legitimate transportation business rather than his role in the smuggling business. According to the source, Luna may have been murdered by business rivals in an attempt to gain control of transportation routes and territory.","Chepe Luna was accused of drug trafficking, human trafficking, and money laundering. The group he led has also been linked to other criminal activities including kidnapping, extortion, and prostitution in several countries throughout Central America.","The Perrones are present in a large portion of El Salvador's territory and are divided into two factions. The eastern group operates in cities such as San Miguel, Usulutan and La Union; While the Westerners group are concentrated around the City of Santa Ana. The organization's activities extend from Panama to Guatemala.The group is adept at moving goods across El Salvador and along the country's border with Honduras and Guatemala, to eventually be moved on to Mexico or the United States. Due to underdevelopment within El Salvador, there is limited air infrastructure, and drug transportation is carried out using trucks.","The Perrones transport drugs and other goods for both Mexican and Colombian criminal groups. It is believed that currently, the group has ties to the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico.There have been reports of a rivalry between the Perrones and the street gangs Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha for the control of trafficking route. However, other reports instead suggest this relationship could be symbiotic as the street gangs control territory in San Salvador and other large urban areas and the Perrones are more established in smaller locales. The Perrones also often hires armed gangs as supportThe group has also established strong relations with government officials in the eastern portion of El Salvador, where the National Conciliation Party and the Nationalist Republic Alliance (ARENA) are prominent.During his career and Luna was able to develop links with the upper echelon of the political elite in the countries where he operated. Following his death, his son published a photo of the criminal with the former president of Honduras Porfirio Lobo, while Lobo was in office.","Luna has been killed and many of the original leaders of Los Perrones such as Daniel Quezada, Reynerio Flores, Juan Colorado have been captured. In April 2019, Chepe Luna's brother, Santos Ernesto Luna, was sentenced to six years in prison for smuggling contraband. However, Los Perrones have regrouped and have managed to remain one of the greatest criminal forces in El Salvador."

As recently as December 2010, he was still on federal payroll for his teaching job.In the public arena, Gomez was a fervent promoter of the Familia’s vigilante ideology, and claimed the group’s ultimate purpose was to protect Michoacan from unwelcome outsiders, namely, the Zetas, a rival criminal gang that trained the original members of the Familia before the group became independent.During a phone interview with a local TV program, ""Voz y Solucion,"" in 2009, Gomez praised President Felipe Calderon and the Army, then claimed the Familia’s only grievances were with the Zetas and the Federal Police for ""attacking our families."" Members of the Familia followed a strict behavioral code and those who disobeyed were ""made to pay,"" he added, unlike the Zetas, about whom he said: ""Most of them are drug addicts.""After his split from the Familia -- whose remnants were led by Jose de Jesus Mendez, alias ""El Chango"" -- Gomez  headed the Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar), a drug trafficking organization with the same quasi-religious sensibility and faux-moral codes as the Familia. The Caballeros announced their appearance in March 2011, and for a while seemed ascendent over the Familia, with Mendez in jail and many analysts considering the old group to be effectively out of action. However, the government soon came down hard on the Knights Templar. The organization also faced pressure from the multiple citizen militia groups that formed in Michoacan throughout 2013 and 2014.Gomez's nephew, girlfriend, mother and brother were all arrested between July and August 2009. That same year, a New York grand jury indicted Gomez for drug trafficking. While Gomez continued to release statements to the public via social media, including one vow that he would never surrender, he was arrested in Morelia, Michoacan in February 2015.In many respects, La Tuta's capture spelled the end for the Knights Templar as a powerful crimininal organization in Mexico.","La Tuta is reportedly charged by Mexican authorities with methamphetamine and marijuana trafficking, as well as posession of military weaponry and ammunition. La Tuta's Knights Templar are also heavily involved in extortion operations in Michoacan.","Prior to his capture, La Tuta was based in Michoacan and Guerrero, and coordinated drug shipments through Baja California.","La Tuta professed to standing up against other Mexican drug trafficking groups such as the Zetas, who inflicted harm on the general population. With the backing of government security forces, self-defense groups have driven the Knights Templar out of several cities in Michoacan. It is believed a significant number of Knights Templar operatives have moved on to other criminal groups, including the self-defense forces.The Jalisco Cartel – New Generation (CJNG) is the newest criminal group challenging the supremacy of the Knights Templar in southwest Mexico.","La Tuta is reportedly wanted in the United States not only on drug trafficking charges, but also for either being a terrorist or belonging to a terrorist organization. This classification is typically reserved for members of illegal Colombian armed groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). However, considering chilly US-Mexico relations surrounding extraditions, it remains to be seen if La Tuta will ever face prison time in the United States."

Following the extradition to the United States of the Bloc’s leader, Carlos Mario Jiménez, alias ""Macaco,"" Pacheco saw an opportunity to seize control of criminal operations in northern Antioquia.Soon Pacheco was facing down a new enemy: Daniel Rendon Herrera, alias ""Don Mario,"" leader of an AUC faction that later began calling themselves the Urabeños. With a band of loyal paramilitaries, Pacheco enlisted the help of the Paisas to help him resist the advance of the Urabeños into Antioquia. The Paisas drew most of their recruits from another paramilitary faction, the Mineros Bloc, in their time reluctant allies of Macaco and his crew. This suspicion carried over into the new generation of drug runners, and Pacheco and the Paisas did not have a comfortable alliance. By 2009, Pacheco decided to switch sides. Pacific-based gang the Rastrojos were also looking to enter Antioquia's Bajo Cauca region, an area with a strong regional identity that does not take to strangers. The Rastrojos recruited Pacheco and his men to fight for them in the area, and Pacheco took their offer. Afterwards, his faction began fighting both the Urabeños and the Paisas.

But his grip on power had steadily been weakening as security forces gradually closed in and he was captured in the municipality of Necoclí, near Colombia's northern border with Panama, Colombia's President Ivan Duque announced on October 23, 2021. Since his capture, the Urabeños have struggled to maintain their cohesion as sub-structures and franchises within the gang have sought more independence without the unifying leadership of Otoniel.After his arrest, Otoniel appeared several times before Colombia's Special Jurisdiction for Peace (JEP) to testify about his participation in organized crime, his history with paramilitary groups, and his connections with authorities.On May 4, 2022, he was extradited to the United States to face drug trafficking charges in the Southern District Court of New York. And in early 2023, he pleaded guilty running a criminal organization, to conspiracy to distribute narcotics by sea, and to conspiracy to import narcotics.","Otoniel began his underworld career as a member of the now-demobilized guerrilla group, the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL). Though he demobilized in 1991, at the age of 19, along with some 2,500 other guerrilla members, he returned to fighting soon after when he and his brother Juan de Dios Úsuga, alias “Giovanni,” signed up with the paramilitary Córdoba and Urabá Peasant Defense Forces (Autodefensas Campesinas de Córdoba y Urabá - ACCU).The ACCU was later incorporated into the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia – AUC), and Otoniel was sent to join the ranks of the AUC’s Centauros Bloc. There, he worked under the bloc’s finance chief, Daniel Rendón Herrera, alias “Don Mario,"" laundering funds and handling extortion payments. In 2005, he again surrendered arms, this time under the AUC’s demobilization process. But once again his demobilization was short lived, and he soon reunited with Don Mario to help form the Urabeños.After Don Mario’s capture by Colombian authorities in 2009, Otoniel and Giovanni assumed complete control of the Urabeños.Under the brothers’ command, the Urabeños expanded across the country using a mix of violence and deal-making, setting them on the path to eventually become the most powerful criminal group in Colombia.In January 2012, the security forces killed Giovanni, leaving Otoniel as the maximum leader of the Urabeños. Since then he has headed a small command group dominated by his ex-comrades from the EPL and AUC. Under Otoniel’s leadership, the Urabeños continued their expansion, either absorbing their rivals or wiping them out, and they soon became the only Colombian criminal organization remaining with a truly national reach.In 2015, the security forces launched Operation Agamemnon, an offensive that sent top anti-drug officials and over 1,000 police and military officials to Urabá to target the Urabeños operations and hunt down Otoniel. The criminal leader made entreaties to the government to negotiate his surrender, including via a public video appeal in which he publicly made the request in September 2017, however, these negotiations did not successfully result in his surrender. That same year, Colombian police stated that Agamemnon had dismantled ""half"" of the Urabeños, although that number is hard to quantify.In 2018, the operation was renewed as Agamemnon 2, with up to 3,000 soldiers reportedly dedicated to fighting the Urabeños. This maintained pressure certainly weakened Otoniel, who saw his closest advisors captured or killed, his brother, sister and cousin arrested and extradited to the United States.In recent years, InSight Crime fieldwork suggested that Otoniel had steadily lost his direct grip on Urabeños operations around the country, with new commanders taking control of key regions of operation.Following his capture, Colombian media reports revealed how he had spent his final months trying to stay ahead of security forces in the Paramillo Massif, a mountain range with numerous waterways, in northern Colombia, moving between campsites and rural properties.After his arrest, Otoniel appeared several times in front of Colombia's Special Jurisdiction for Peace (Jurisdicción Especial para la Paz – JEP) to testify about his criminal group's involvement in organized crime, his history with paramilitary groups and their links to authorities and public figures.His extradition to the United States in May 2022 set up a landmark trial in which numerous revelations about the full extent of his criminal activities are set to be revealed. After Otoniel pleaded guilty in January 2023, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Breon Peace, stated that ""With today’s guilty plea, the bloody reign of the most violent and significant Colombian narcotics trafficker since Pablo Escobar is over.""As part of his guilty plea, Otoniel agreed to hand over $216 million and faces prison time of between 20 years and life. ","Otoniel was the leader of one of Colombia’s largest criminal organizations, which controls strategic drug production and trafficking territories and provides services to independent drug traffickers. He also mean drug routes as a trafficker in his own right. Local Urabeños cells are also involved in a broad range of criminal activities, including extortion, illegal mining, microtrafficking and contraband, and many of these had to pay a percentage of their profits to the national leadership headed by Otoniel.Following his arrest, the Colombian government released a list of his alleged crimes, accusing him of ""aggravated homicide, illicit recruitment, conspiracy to commit crimes, extortion and kidnapping, terrorism, illegal carrying of weapons, drug trafficking...forced disappearances and illegal recruitment of minors.""","Otoniel was believed to largely operate in his home region and Urabeños stronghold, Urabá, a subdivision of Colombia's northwestern department of Antioquia, as well as in Córdoba, a neighboring department to the north. He lived on the run, and reportedly used guerrilla tactics to avoid capture, including traveling only by foot or mule and never sleeping in the same place on consecutive nights.In October 2021, he was captured by government forces in Necoclí, a coastal municipality in northern Colombia, near the border with Panama.","Otoniel and his brother, Giovanni, expanded the Urabeños influence by violently confronting rivals such as the Rastrojos, while making allies of local criminal groups and drug traffickers across the country. In many cases these actors became part of the Urabeños “franchise.” In some regions, the group also struck drug trade agreements with the now-demobilized guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC).In the city of Medellín they made a pact with the city mafia, the Oficina de Envigado, with which they had previously fought for control of the city. They also contract out tasks to street gangs, for crimes such as microtrafficking, extortion and targeted killings.Amid underworld shake-ups in the wake of the demobilization of the FARC, Otoniel’s Urabeños became embroiled in bitter turf wars with the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) guerrilla and ex-FARC Mafia groups.In 2020 and 2021, the group also became involved, albeit in a limited manner, in the ongoing scramble for cross-border criminal economies between Colombia and Venezuela, reportedly reaching some sort of alliance with their old enemies, the Rastrojos, to fight the ELN there. Their impact inside Venezuela, compared to the ELN or ex-FARC Mafia, has remained somewhat limited, however. Since this evolution happened in the final months of Otoniel's freedom, it is uncertain how much sway he had on this development.Since 2015, Otoniel and Urabeños leadership had been the target of Operation Agamemnon. This placed Otoniel on the back foot as he reportedly had to regularly move camp around Urabá and other parts of Antioquia. While security forces did take several years to finally track him down, speaking to the support Otoniel received and knowledge of the area among his forces, this sustained pressure eventually caught up with him.His successor within the Urabeños appears to be Jobanis de Jesús Ávila Villadiego, alias ""Chiquito Malo."" An old guard within the group, Chiquito Malo has a strong grasp of drug trafficking and other criminal economies within Urabá, the Urabeños' heartland, but may struggle to keep the group united across Colombia. ","Otoniel's criminal career is finished after his arrest in October 2021 and his subsequent extradition to the United States in May 2022. While he had remained the leader of the AGC, he had been the subject of an unusually dogged manhunt by Colombian authorities since Operation Agamemnon was launched in 2015. This had led to the capture of his brother and second-in-command in 2019 and his sister in 2021. He now faces criminal charges at federal courts in Manhattan and Brooklyn in New York as well as Miami and Tampa in Florida. He pleaded guilty in New York and faces a potential life sentence.The question now is what becomes of the organization he once ran. While President Duque called his arrest the most significant blow to Colombian drug trafficking since the arrest of Pablo Escobar, the direct impact of this capture is uncertain. As he lived on the run, Otoniel had become increasingly isolated, and his offer to surrender to the government almost certainly weakened his grip over the different Urabeños factions. Investigations by InSight Crime indicated that Otoniel, for several years, no longer had the complete loyalty of the organization’s commanders, who only obeyed his orders when it was in their interest."

Following the arrest of Don Mario in 2009, the Úsuga brothers became the leaders of the criminal organization based in Colombia's northwest region of Urabá.With Úsuga in charge, the Urabeños escalated a violent turf battle with the Paisas and the Rastrojos in southern Cordoba and in the Lower Cauca region, northern Antioquia. In 2009, the towns of Caucasia and Tarazá saw soaring murder rates, as Úsuga tried to take control of these drug distribution centers, both located on a major highway connecting Medellín to the Caribbean coast. The amount of land used for coca cultivation in Córdoba also doubled between 2008 and 2009, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). Colombian anti-narcotics police have said this may be related to the expanded Urabeños presence.","According to police, Úsuga ran the Urabeños operations in northern Colombia, and oversaw drug routes and distribution points, as well as illicit crops in the region. Authorities have offered 500 million Colombian pesos ($278,000) in return for information leading to the capture of him or his brother. In March 2010, the US Treasury Department added Úsuga to its drug ""Kingpin List.""","Úsuga operated in the Urabeños stronghold of Urabá in northwest Colombia. Úsuga was very security conscious, and reportedly only moved between a small area of land in northern Antioquia that was firmly under the control of his criminal organization.","Úsuga reportedly had contact with all the major drug traffickers in northern Colombia. The Urabeños worked closely with Henry de Jesus López Londoño, alias ""Mi Sangre,"" who joined the criminal organization in 2009 and expanded the group's presence into the city of Medellín. At the time of his death, the Urabeños were battling rival criminal group the Rastrojos.","Úsuga was taken down in a raid by security forces on his ranch in Choco province, near the border with Panama, in the early hours of January 1, 2012.

Subsequently, El Viceroy ordered the murder of El Chapo's brother, who was in prison at the time.The end of the alliance triggered a violent war between the two cartels, which had already fought over drug markets and trafficking routes. As of 2007, El Viceroy also faced a conflict with the Gulf Cartel, which for several years turned his hometown of Ciudad Juárez into the world's most violent city and left at least 8,000 dead.In order to confront the Sinaloa Cartel and its hitmen, known as ""Gente Nueva,"" El Viceroy strengthened the armed wing ""La Línea"" and the US-based gang ""Barrio Azteca."" But this was not enough to defeat El Chapo Guzmán's cartel, which presumably enjoyed the support of federal authorities. Eventually, the Sinaloa Cartel managed to weaken the Juárez Cartel and increased its own power, as La Linea and Barrio Azteca changed sides during the course of the fight.After the alleged defeat, El Viceroy changed his name and appearance, and moved to the city of Torreón, Coahuila, where he was captured on October 9, 2014. He was sentenced to 28 years in prison. He is currently detained in a prison in Puente Grande in the state of Jalisco.","In 2000, a Texas federal jury charged El Viceroy with 46 criminal offences associated with drug trafficking and money laundering. He also faces charges of murder, carrying restricted military weapons, and establishing criminal organizations. He was also indicted on drug crimes by a New York federal court in 2009.In addition, Mexico's Attorney General's Office claimed that El Viceroy controlled one of the most important cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine and marijuana trafficking routes between Mexico and the United States.El Viceroy was known to be the most violent of the Carrillo Fuentes brothers. As noted in the book ""Los Capos,"" by Ricardo Ravelo, Vicente occasionally killed his enemies with his own hands and ordered them buried in mass graves. Sometimes they were buried alive. Moreover, the Juárez Cartel was the first criminal group to use car bombs in attacks against the police.","El Viceroy ran the Juárez Cartel from the border town in Chihuahua that gave the group its name: Ciudad Juárez.After the group lost its influence in Chihuahua due to the conflict with the Sinaloa Cartel, El Viceroy fled to the city of Torreón in Coahuila.During his time as head of the cartel, El Viceroy managed to control the activities of the cartel in more than a dozen states in the country.","Up until 2004, the Juárez Cartel had maintained an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel, but eventually turned into its biggest rival. The Gulf Cartel was also one of the enemies the Juárez Cartel confronted during the conflict in Ciudad Juárez.In 2008, El Viceroy managed to establish one of the most crucial alliances in the fight against the Sinaloa Cartel by partnering with former allies of El Chapo, the Beltran Leyva Organization. Additionally, the Juárez Cartel was associated with the Zetas and drug suppliers in Colombia, such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC).","As the Carrillo Fuentes brothers personally controlled the Juárez Cartel, their deaths and arrests significantly weakened the organization. Nevertheless, small cells are still operating in Chihuahua and continue to fight the Sinaloa Cartel.In 2015, US authorities issued a request for the extradition of El Viceroy. The request, however, was suspended, and at least for the time being, El Viceroy will remain in prison in Mexico."
"Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias 'Valenciano'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/maximiliano-bonilla-orozco-valenciano/,Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco,Valenciano,./images/individuals/maximiliano-bonilla-orozco.jpg,2016-11-07,"['colombia personalities', 'oficina de envigado', 'valenciano']",colombia,"Maximiliano Bonilla Orozco, alias ""Valenciano,"" was a leader in the Colombian criminal organization Oficina de Envigado, and forged ties with international trafficking organizations such as the Zetas in Mexico. He was captured in Venezuela in November 2011 and later extradited to the United States. In 2016, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison on drug trafficking-related charges.","Bonilla reportedly began working for the founder of the Medellín-based organization Oficina de Envigado, Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" when he was still a teenager. Bonilla's father had worked for Murillo until he was assassinated in 1985 in Medellín. Murillo took Bonilla under his wing, and the latter started to work as an assassin on behalf of his boss. By the age of 15, Bonilla had turned into one of Murillo's most lethal and respected assassins.Murillo's surprise extradition to the United States in 2008 precipitated a crisis within the Oficina. Murillo's successor Carlos Mario Aguilar, alias ""Rogelio,"" surrendered to authorities, and other associates were arrested. The organization split into two opposing factions -- one led by Bonilla and another by fellow Oficina boss Erickson Vargas Cárdenas, known as ""Sebastián."" Bonilla sought to consolidate his control over Colombia's drug-trafficking routes by kidnapping and killing most of those allied with Vargas. The ensuing conflict claimed an estimated 6,000 lives in Medellín between 2008 and 2011.The internal warfare did not prevent Bonilla from aggressively expanding his area of influence The Oficina boss spread his influence into the Guajira, Atlántico and Bolívar departments, filling the power voids left behind after the demobilization of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC).In 2008, he seized an important drug corridor through the Urabá region on the Caribbean coast, after the extradition of Daniel Rendón Herrera, alias ""Don Mario."" He gained control of more trafficking routes through Córdoba following the capture of Victor Mejía, who headed up the ""Mellizos"" drug trafficking organization.In the months leading up to his capture, Bonilla faced increasing pressure, both from enemies and allies, as some of his associates tried to follow Aguilar to the United States to become co-operating witnesses. In July 2009, his partner, Mauricio Lóopez Cardona, alias ""Yiyo,"" turned himself in to Colombian authorities. Another leader of the Oficina, Fabio Leóon Véelez Correa, alias ""Nito,"" was killed by his own subordinates for seeking a similar deal with US authorities.Bonilla refused to cede power, and the internal feuds within the Oficina grew more aggressive as Bonilla became increasingly paranoid that his associates might be clandestinely negotiating to give him up.Bonilla was long thought to be hiding on Colombia's Caribbean coast, but was arrested in November 2011 in the city of Maracay, Venezuela. His capture was the result of years of tracking by the Colombian intelligence services, and he was eventually taken into custody on the eve of a visit by President Juan Manuel Santos. He was extradited to the United States almost immediately and, five years later, he was sentenced to 20 years in prison by a district judge in New York.","Bonilla became a key figure in the drug trafficking activities of the Oficina de Envigado after starting out as an assassin for the group. In Urabá he set up a network for drug and arms trafficking, as well as the extortion of businesses. According to the US State Department, Bonilla headed a network that shipped several tons of cocaine to the United States.Bonilla was indicted by US authorities in 2008. He secretly pleaded guilty the same year and reportedly agreed to help track down members of the Zetas in Mexico in exchange for a reduced prison sentence. However, after returning to Colombia he continued his criminal operations and failed to cooperate with North American prosecutors. In 2010, the US State Department offered a $5 million reward for information leading to Bonilla's arrest. He was eventually captured in Venezuela in November 2011.","While working with the Oficina de Envigado -- which has its base of operations in and around Medellín -- Bonilla expanded the group's area of influence, and established drug trafficking routes through the Urabá region. He is thought to be responsible for the escalation of criminal activities in and around Medellín, other areas in the departments of Antioquia and Córdoba, and various areas in the Atlantic Coast, including the cities of Barranquilla, Santa Marta and Cartagena.","Following Murillo's extradition, Bonilla entered war of succession with another top-ranking member of the organization, Erickson Vargas Cárdenas, alias ""Sebastián"".After Bonilla himself was extradited in 2011, he allegedly helped police authorities to capture his archenemy Vargas, suggesting they should track down alias ""Freddy Colas,"" Vargas's security coordinator. It was reportedly thanks to Bonilla's advice that authorities managed to capture Vargas in August 2012.One of Bonilla's allies was Rubén Darío Moreno Urrego, alias ""Pichi Grande,"" who led the Mondongueros band, in northwest Medellín.Bonilla's network extended beyond Colombia's borders, and Bonilla is said to have worked with criminal groups around the region, including Mexico's Zetas.","Bonilla was captured in Venezuela in November 2011 and was extradited weeks later. In 2016, a New York court sentenced him to 20 years in prison."
"Luciano Marín Arango, alias 'Iván Márquez'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/luciano-marin-ivan-marquez/,Luciano Marín Arango,Iván Márquez,./images/individuals/luciano-marín-arango.jpg,2022-09-29,"['colombia', 'colombia personalities', 'farc', 'iván márquez']",colombia,"Luciano Marín Arango, alias ""Iván Márquez,"" is a former guerrilla commander who has called on demobilized fighters to join a dissident force helmed by ex-leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC), known as the Segunda Marquetalia.Marquez, wearing fatigues and carrying a pistol, declared in a video that the group would return to war, claiming the Colombian state had ""betrayed"" the peace accords signed in 2016 between the government and the FARC. The address -- published on YouTube in August 2019 – threatened to jeopardize the entire peace process further.Márquez, as the former second-in-command of the FARC, was able to attract many ex-guerrillas back to criminality and received pledges of loyalty from certain ex-FARC Mafia groups.He also rapidly set up a base of operations for the Second Marquetalia in Venezuela, capitalizing on opportunities to get involved in drug trafficking, illegal gold mining, and contraband. However, he faced significant setbacks in his attempts to gain control of the border region. At the end of 2021, three of his senior commanders were killed in Venezuela, leaving Márquez dangerously alone and exposed.Márquez apparently went into hiding in December 2021 to avoid a similar fate. He remained off the radar until July 2022, when rumors that he had been killed in Venezuela began circulating. However, the Second Marquetalia always denied his death.Colombia's Higher Commissioner for Peace confirmed that Márquez is alive, although still recovering, and that overtures had been made to explore the ""possibility of a dialogue"" with the Second Marquetalia.","Iván Márquez was born on June 6, 1955, in Florencia, the capital city of Colombia's southern Caquetá department. Like many of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia's (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) oldest members, Márquez was part of the Colombian Communist Party Youth Organization (Juventud Comunista Colombiana – JUCO), joining in 1977.As a member of the JUCO, he supported the FARC in part by taking provisions to the group in the countryside. He joined the FARC in 1985 as a political commissioner for one of the rebels' most active units, the 14th Front in Caquetá.In the early 1980s, as part of a peace process between the Colombian government and the FARC, Márquez became a top emissary for the rebels' nascent political party, the Patriotic Union (Union Patriótica – UP). He was later elected as a city council member and then as an alternate congressman for Caquetá.In 1987, as the persecution of UP members intensified, the FARC called Márquez and other top rebel emissaries in the party back to the mountains. The rebels named him commander of the Southwest Bloc for his efforts with the UP.In the 1990s, Márquez was transferred to the northwestern part of the country, where he took part in a bloody battle for control of the Urabá region along the Colombia-Panama border.This earned Márquez respect within the FARC as a strong military commander, complementing his political skills. The combination of these two abilities contributed to his trajectory as an international representative of the organization. His activities and influence spread far and wide: he became the guerrillas' top foreign emissary, and intelligence officials in Colombia said he headed efforts to infiltrate universities and create student federations to support the FARC's political and military strategy in Colombian cities.Thanks to his political and diplomatic skills, Márquez was chosen to head the FARC's delegation for peace talks with the Colombian government in Havana in 2012. He continued to head the guerrillas' negotiating team after the talks moved to Havana in November of the same year.After four years at the negotiating table, followed by the signing of the peace accords in 2016, Márquez joined the Monitoring and Implementation Commission of the Agreement (Comisión de Seguimiento, Impulso y Verificación a la Implementación del Acuerdo), the mechanism created to ensure both parties implement the accords.With the transition of the FARC to a political party called the Common Alternative Revolutionary Force (Fuerza Alternativa Revolucionaria del Común – FARC) between August and September 2017, the FARC Secretariat became the party's national directorate. Márquez received the most votes during the party's founding congress.A year later, however, the peace process was beset by turmoil after Jesús Santrich's arrest on drug trafficking charges. Considering the April 2018 arrest a setup, Márquez refused his post as a senator in the Colombian congress, which had been granted to him as part of the accords. In an interview, Márquez said his refusal was evidence the peace process had failed and questioned how he could be a senator ""when they'll say I'm a drug trafficker."" He also demanded that the government comply with stipulations in the agreement that had not been fulfilled, such as funding projects for ex-FARC members.Amid this uncertainty, Márquez moved to a reintegration camp in Miravalle, a village in the municipality of San Vicente del Caguán in the southwest Caquetá department. The Training and Reincorporation Space (Espacios Territoriales de Capacitación y Reincorporación – ETCR) was headed by former FARC commander Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias ""El Paisa,"" who previously led the militant Teófilo Forero Mobile Column.Sometime later, he fled from the camp along with El Paisa and went into hiding. He wasn't heard from until May 2019, when he sent a message via Twitter saying that the FARC guerrillas made a ""grave error"" when they put down their weapons.In December 2021, after the deaths of some of his closest allies within the Second Marquetalia, Márquez allegedly went into hiding. He was not heard of publicly until July 2022, when widespread rumors of his death in Venezuela surfaced.","According to the US State Department, Iván Márquez was in charge of the FARC's drug policies, directing and controlling the production, manufacture, and distribution of cocaine. Eventually, the State Department offered $5 million for information leading to his arrest. He also commanded FARC units accused of kidnapping, extortion and murder.Before the peace agreement was signed and amnesty was subsequently granted, the Colombian government considered Márquez a narco-terrorist.In April 2018, US authorities revealed that Márquez was investigated for alleged cocaine trafficking after he was caught speaking to a supposed Mexican cartel operative on a cellphone video. The investigation is the same one that has led to drug charges against his comrade, Santrich. It stems from a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) operation in which Marlon Marín, Marquez's nephew and assistant, was observed retrieving $5 million from a DEA informant. The money was exchanged for the movement of ten tons of cocaine to Mexico's powerful Sinaloa Cartel.Márquez is also a significant target of the US government, which offered a $10 million reward for his capture.As the head of the Second Marquetalia, troops under his command control much of the drug trafficking along the border between Colombia and Venezuela, specifically in Arauca and Apure.","Before heading up the FARC's peace negotiating team, Márquez primarily operated in northern Colombia. As commander of the Caribbean Bloc, his zones of influence included the Serranía del Perijá mountain range, the departments of La Guajira and Cesar, and some regions along the Colombia-Venezuela border.While groups associated with the Second Marquetalia operated elsewhere in Colombia, its firm base of operations since 2019 has been the Venezuelan state of Apure. However, following the death of much of its leadership, it is uncertain how long the group and Márquez will control this territory.","Historically, the main enemies of FARC leaders like Márquez have included extreme right-wing elements of Colombia's political elite, some of whom have had ties to paramilitary groups.However, the FARC has seen its share of infighting as well. A rift formed in its ruling body when Rodrigo Londoño Echeverri, alias ""Timochenko,"" assumed leadership of the FARC because Márquez was also a candidate for the guerrilla group's top position. Although the replacement of FARC commanders had been resolved through its handover mechanism, the succession of Guillermo León Sáenz Vargas, alias ""Alfonso Cano,"" was a challenge for the rebel group.In the wake of successful military operations against its commanders, the FARC increasingly depended on young leaders due to its need to continue with the chain of command. This meant that even though Márquez was a strong contender for the top leadership position, Timochenko took the reins because he had more years of service in the Secretariat under his belt.The division became most evident as the FARC transitioned into a political party. Márquez earned more votes than Timochenko to be elected to the party's national directorate after running on a more critical line regarding the implementation of the peace agreement.Following his return to criminality and the creation of the Second Marquetalia, Márquez made numerous enemies. His troops frequently clashed with other ex-FARC Mafia groups, commanded by Gentil Duarte, as well as the ELN. They also came under sustained pressure from Colombian and Venezuelan authorities. This pressure began to tell as three top commanders, Hernán Darío Velásquez, better known as ""El Paisa,"" Seuxis Pausías Hernández, alias ""Jesús Santrich,"" and Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias ""Romaña,"" were all killed in Venezuela in 2021.In July 2022, it emerged that Márquez himself might have been killed in Venezuela as well, but it was later alleged he had only been injured and was convalescing in a Caracas hospital.","Márquez is one of the more radical leaders among the ex-FARC Mafia and has used his leadership position to try and undermine the peace agreement, being highly critical of how it was handled. His platform and authority among former guerrilla fighters make his message likely to find listeners. As the former second-in-command of the FARC, his position as the leader of the Second Marquetalia endows the group with a sense of legacy as the continuation of the original FARC.His deep insider knowledge of the FARC's operations, his experience of combat tactics and the respect he carries makes Márquez one of the principal criminal actors in Colombia and Venezuela, with the ability to wield real influence in both countries.However, following the deaths of most of the Second Marquetalia leadership, Márquez's power has significantly weakened. While troops under his command still control significant drug trafficking between Colombia and Venezuela, any chance of broader political achievements is unlikely."

He was detained by Mexican marines in September 2012 and extradited to the United States in September 2015.For years, El Coss managed the Gulf Cartel’s security, including the Zetas, the former armed wing of the group. He rose to the top after the arrest of famed Gulf boss Osiel Cárdenas Guillén in 2003.His fearless approach and legendary temper have got him into many difficult situations. In November 1999, he was part of an armed group that stopped and held several US federal agents at gunpoint. He released them, but the incident earned him his first indictment in the United States.By 2007, he was reportedly communicating with the Zetas via telephone rather than meeting with them in person. In 2010, the Gulf Cartel murdered a top member of the Zetas, and the group sought retribution. When El Coss refused to hand over the killer, the Zetas declared war, and since then the northeastern states of Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and Coahuila have become some of the most violent in Mexico.El Coss was arrested on September 12, 2012, in the Gulf Cartel stronghold of Tamaulipas. El Coss, alongside fellow drug lord Edgar Váldez Villarreal, alias ""La Barbie,"" was extradited to the United States on September 30, 2015.On September 26, 2017, El Coss pleaded guilty in a US federal court to drug trafficking charges and two counts of assault.It was not until 2022 that he was sentenced to life imprisonment.

"Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias 'El Chapo'",https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/joaquin-guzman-loera-el-chapo/,Joaquín Guzmán Loera,El Chapo,./images/individuals/joaquín-guzmán-loera.jpg,2019-03-29,"['el chapo', 'mexico personalities', 'sinaloa cartel']",mexico,"Mexican drug lord Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" was once the head of Mexico's most powerful organized crime group, the Sinaloa Cartel. His ability to simultaneously co-opt public officials, attack enemies' strongholds, and find creative ways to get his drugs to market has made him a legend in the underworld.Before his capture in February 2014, Guzmán was the most wanted man in the Western Hemisphere. He escaped once again from prison, crawling through a tunnel, on July 11, 2015, prompting a massive manhunt in Mexico. On January 8, 2016, President Enrique Peña Nieto said via Twitter that the government had re-arrested the fugitive Sinaloa Cartel leader. A little over one year later, on January 19, 2017, Mexican authorities announced his extradition in a communique issued less than 24 hours before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th US President.El Chapo's reign came to an end once and for all on February 12, 2019, when a US jury found him guilty on all 10 counts included in the federal indictment against him, including leading an ongoing criminal enterprise, which carries a life sentence in federal US prison without the possibility of parole.","Born in a small farming community in Badiraguato, Sinaloa state, Guzmán spent his childhood shuttling oranges to the market. With his uncle's help, he moved into contraband and later coordinated large shipments of marijuana and finally cocaine, in Sinaloa state and later to the United States. He may have little formal education, but he has a Ph.D. in drug trafficking. Guzmán is known as a pioneer in the trade, having essentially leased an airplane hangar in Mexico City's principal airport for years, and led the way in constructing tunnels beneath the US-Mexico border.El Chapo's career has also been marked by infighting and bloodshed. He split from the core group of Guadalajara-based traffickers in the 1990s and began a bloody fight with the Tijuana Cartel, also known as the Arellano Felix Organization, which ran the lucrative Tijuana trafficking corridor. After an attempt on his life in 1993, Guzmán fled to Guatemala, where he was arrested by the authorities and deported back to Mexico. From jail, he continued plying his trade, with his brother, Arturo Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Pollo,"" managing the business. His cohorts from Sinaloa, Arturo and Hector Beltran Leyva, regularly brought him suitcases of cash so he could grease the wheels of power inside the prison and continue his opulent lifestyle, including specially prepared meals and conjugal visits from his wife, girlfriends and prostitutes. His friend, ally and relative by marriage, Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, alias ""El Azul,"" made sure that Guzmán's product got to the United States without interference from his rivals.Guzmán escaped prison in 2001, just as authorities were laying the groundwork for his extradition to the United States. He eluded capture for more than a decade by creating a sophisticated security system, allegedly basing himself in isolated, rural areas of Sinaloa and Durango.While Chapo was on the run, there were a number of seeming close calls that later turned out be fabricated. In February 2012, Mexican authorities reported that they had come the closest ever to catching Guzmán. However, later reports indicated that the operation had never occurred, and that the false information may have been an effort to boost Calderon's popularity in the run-up to the 2012 elections. In February 2013, authorities in Guatemala -- the same country responsible for his jail stint in the 1990s -- reported Guzmán's possible death in a shootout, a report that was also found to be false. Numerous musicians have celebrated his ability to elude capture and undermine the authorities.In the early hours of February 22, 2014, Guzmán was captured by Mexican Marines in a hotel in the Mexican beach resort city of Mazatlan. At the time of his arrest he was the most wanted criminal on the planet and had a $5 million reward on his head.Despite pressure from US officials for his extradition nearly as soon as he was captured in February, tense US-Mexico relations have left in doubt whether the cartel boss will ever face justice in the United States.On July 11, 2015, Mexico authorities reported that El Chapo has escaped from his maximum-security prison yet again. No laundry cart was reportedly involved this time, as was the case for his legendary escape in 2001. He apparently crawled through a tunnel that was 1.5 kilometers wide and led directly into his prison shower cell, according to reports. On January 8, 2016, Mexico's president wrote on Twitter, ""Mission accomplished: we have him. I would like to inform the Mexican people that Joaquin Guzmán Loera has been arrested."" On January 19, 2017, El Chapo was extradited to the United States, just hours before Donald Trump's inauguration, in a move that spurred debate as to what message president Peña Nieto intended to send to the incoming US head of state.After a three-month federal drug trafficking trial in the United States, El Chapo was found guilty in February 2019 on all 10 counts in the federal indictment against him including charges ranging from drug trafficking to money laundering and leading an ongoing criminal enterprise. He faces a mandatory minimum life sentence in federal US prison -- likely in the so-called “Alcatraz of the Rockies,” or ADX Florence, the United States’ only supermax prison.","Before his arrest in 2014, Guzmán was widely considered the world's biggest drug trafficker and among the most wanted criminals on the planet. With Chapo at the helm, the Sinaloa Cartel came to dominate the global cocaine market, and became a major player in the trafficking of heroin, methamphetamine, and marijuana.Guzmán's immense fortune from drug trafficking -- in 2009 he was included on the Forbes list of billionaires (he was later dropped from its rankings in 2013) -- required a sophisticated money laundering system to legitimize the illicit funds.","Guzmán was allegedly based in rural parts of Sinaloa and Durango prior to his capture in 2014. However, while the drug lord was on the run rumors swirled that he was hiding out or operating in various countries, including Honduras, Argentina, Guatemala, Bolivia, and even the United States. Guzmán was eventually arrested in the beach resort city of Mazatlan, Sinaloa.Guzmán's Sinaloa Cartel is believed to have a presence in nearly every major city in the United States and Latin America. Within Mexico, the cartel is believed to operate in 17 states throughout the country.","Under Guzmán's watch, the Sinaloa Cartel waged a bloody turf war with its rival the Juarez Cartel during the mid-2000s for control of valuable drug trafficking routes near the US border. The Sinaloa Cartel emerged victorious, cementing its position as the foremost drug trafficking organization in Mexico.Following a split with the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) in 2008, the cartel forged alliances with former rivals the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana. However, both the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacan are shadows of their former selves, with many of their leaders either killed or captured.Guzmán created the hemisphere's largest drug cartel with many of those who helped in prison, including Esparragoza and the Beltran Leyva brothers. Guzmán has also spent a significant amount of time and effort cultivating support among Mexicans, especially in rural areas where contraband and drug trafficking is a way of life.Guzmán's family is deeply involved in trafficking and his battles with his rivals cost him his brother, Arturo, who was killed in prison in 2004 while Guzmán carried on a dispute with the Zetas; his son, Edgar Guzmán Lopez, who was killed in May 2008 in Culiacan, Sinaloa, amidst Joquin's dispute with his former allies, the Beltran Leyva Organization; his longtime girlfriend from his time in jail, Zulema Hernandez, who was found in the trunk of a car in 2008, strangled to death and with the letter ""Z"" carved into her body, presumably by rival group the Zetas.The Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) and the National Action Party (PAN) have long traded barbs, accusing each other of being beholden to Guzmán. The reality is that both may have factions allied to the trafficker, as do parts of the military and police throughout Mexico and other neighboring countries.","Guzmán's stunning second escape from a maximum-security prison in July 2015 sparked an immediate, massive manhunt for the Sinaloa Cartel head. There is widespread suspicion of high-level official collusion, and the government has come under intense pressure to recapture Guzmán quickly, which they did on January 8, 2016. After Chapo's extradition to the United States in early 2017, speculation swirled about whether or not the former kingpin would testify during his own trial, he never did. El Chapo will spend the rest of his natural life in prison.But this did not mark the end of the Sinaloa Cartel, and will unlikely have any significant impact on the criminal map in Mexico, as the group carries on with El Mayo and Guzmán's sons at the top of the organization. El Chapo’s sons are effectively under the wing of El Mayo as he allegedly tries to reestablish order among the country’s criminal groups as Mexico’s last true remaining drug capo."

Along with his now captured and convicted partner, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo,” El Mayo is one of the most storied drug traffickers in Mexican history.","Originally a farmer from the western state of Sinaloa, El Mayo started working with the Juarez Cartel in the 1980s and 1990s. After the death of the head of the Juarez Cartel, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, alias “El Señor de los Cielos,” El Mayo created his own organization. With the slow demise of the Tijuana Cartel, El Mayo has sought to expand his routes through the northwestern states of Sonora and Baja California. He also controls much of the heroin production and shipment from Mexico into the United States.In 2004, the US government offered a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture. In recent years, El Mayo has suffered the loss of several key members of his inner circle. Authorities have arrested his brother, two sons and a nephew. One of his sons, Ismael Zambada, alias “El Mayito,” was extradited to the United States in 2010. In 2012, El Mayo’s alleged right-hand man, Manuel Torres Felix, alias “El M-1” or “El Ondeado,"" was killed in a shootout with the military.Some analysts surmised that El Mayo might be easing into the shadows, or even retiring, after he appeared on the front cover of the Mexican investigative news magazine Proceso in 2010. However, El Mayo survived a February 2017 attack reportedly carried out by Dámaso “Licenciado” López Núñez, another Sinaloa Cartel leader. The ambush also targeted two of El Chapo’s sons, suggesting an internal struggle for power following the drug boss’s capture and extradition to the United States earlier that year.However, Licenciado was arrested soon after in Mexico City in May. Then Licenciado’s son, Damáso López Serrano, alias “Mini Lic,” later turned himself in to US authorities July. This left El Mayo at the top of the Sinaloa Cartel to oversee the group’s operations and watch over El Chapo’s sons, known collectively as “Los Chapitos,” who are now the next target for US authorities.In contrast, El Mayo's sons have either all been arrested and jailed in the United States or seem to be lying low.El Mayo is getting older and is rumored to be in bad health and battling diabetes. For now, however, he is the last remaining member of the Sinaloa Cartel’s old guard, and will likely continue to run the show while he is still able.","Following the extradition of El Chapo to the United States in January 2017 and the May 2017 arrest of Licenciado, some consider El Mayo to have claimed the top spot in one of the world’s most powerful criminal organizations. El Mayo oversees much of Mexico’s heroin production, largely bound for the booming market in the United States. And the Sinaloa Cartel is still a dominant player in the international cocaine trade. ","El Mayo is originally from Sinaloa, and he is believed to operate out of the mountainous regions in Sinaloa, Durango, and Chihuahua -- the so-called “Golden Triangle"" of drug production in Mexico, and a longtime Sinaloa Cartel stronghold. However, El Mayo’s influence is thought to extend throughout much of Mexico, and the Sinaloa Cartel has a presence in almost every major city in the Western Hemisphere. ","El Mayo has made and broken many alliances with other drug trafficking organizations. His partnership with El Chapo has been cited as a major reason why the Sinaloa Cartel is the strongest in the hemisphere. El Mayo has also used his connections in the Mexican government to push his influence steadily north toward the US border and south toward Cancún, leaving a trail of imprisoned and dead colleagues in his wake.More recently, as Mexico’s criminal landscape succumbs to increased fragmentation, El Mayo is reportedly leading a campaign in part through the use of narco-banners to align belligerent groups that otherwise risk being captured or killed.","Even before El Chapo’s extradition in 2017, El Mayo was a major figure within the Sinaloa Cartel, and perhaps even of equal stature with his former boss on the operational side. With El Chapo out of the picture and internal power struggles roiling the organization, El Mayo will likely play an important role in the cartel’s future, despite a power play by Los Chapitos.El Mayo has proven himself remarkably adept at evading arrest. His deep connections in government and the local population in Sinaloa have helped him spend over 40 years in the drug trafficking business without ever seeing the inside of a jail cell. At this point, it appears that El Mayo’s deteriorating health may get to him before authorities do. "

The brothers went on to work for Amado Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""El Señor de los Cielos,"" the head of the Juarez Cartel, as hitmen and transporters. In 2002, Hector and his brothers forged an alliance with Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" and his partners, and formed what was known as the Federation, or the ""Alianza de Sangre"" (Blood Alliance).However, in 2008 the Beltran Leyva brothers split with El Chapo after the arrest of Alfredo, which they believed El Chapo had orchestrated. As the BLO battled the Sinaloa Cartel, Arturo was killed in 2009.As his brothers began to fall one by one, Hector assumed the BLO's leadership and ran what was left of the organization in conjunction with the Zetas, the group's former rivals. Before he took over as leader, Hector had previously operated the financial wing of the BLO and was responsible for keeping politicians and police on the payroll. Nevertheless, Hector was not the obvious choice to become his group's leader, and his tenure saw the BLO's power decline significantly.He was eventually captured in 2014 at a food restaurant in San Miguel Allende in Guanajuato, accompanied by his bodyguard, but evaded a US extradition request.He died in November 2018 at the age of 56 from a heart attack while serving prison time in the Altiplano maximum security prison.","The BLO is primarily a drug trafficking organization, and Hector mainly dealt with the financial side of the operations and managed the group's connections with politicians, businessmen and security personnel.","The BLO formed in Mexico's Sinaloa state and operated in Guerrero, Morelos, Chiapas, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Nuevo Leon, and Mexico State at the height of its power.

He joined the ELN in 1964, at age 14, when the insurgency was but an idea. In 1965, Gabino participated in the ELN’s first military assaults in the municipality of Simacota, Santander. In 1973, he became part of the national leadership council after two founding members died in battle.In the late 1970s, he assumed joint leadership with Manuel Perez, alias ""El Cura,"" the Spanish priest who had joined the group in the 1960s. After El Cura's death in 1998, Gabino became commander in chief of the ELN. He is considered the ELN’s main strategist and its elder statesman, having seen the group’s beginnings and its near endings.Gabino also opened the way for peace talks on several occasions, including trying to join government negotiations with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) in 2012. The ELN and the Colombian government announced ""exploratory"" peace talks in June 2014, and in March 2016 announced a formal negotiating agenda.The talks collapsed in January 2019, following the bombing of a police training academy in Bogotá by the ELN. Gabino and the rest of the ELN's negotiating team have remained stranded in Cuba since.","The ELN is involved in practically every major lucrative criminal economy in Colombia and Venezuela, from illegal mining to drug trafficking and from extortion and kidnapping to arms trafficking.However, Gabino has always remained fiercely opposed to the ELN's participation in drug trafficking, repeatedly distancing the group from involvement in this criminal economy.In terms of Gabino personally, he has been tried in absentia for his involvement in multiple crimes, including a 1998 massacre in which 84 people died after the ELN bombed an oil pipeline in Antioquia, and the mass kidnapping of over 100 people from a church in Cali in 1999.","Gabino's ELN group operates throughout Colombia and Venezuela and has spread rapidly in recent years to become arguably the principal criminal threat in both countries.He is currently residing in Cuba since the ELN's peace talks with the Colombian government collapsed in January 2019, and the two countries are fighting over his extradition.","Gabino is wanted by the Colombian and US governments due to his longstanding membership of the ELN, which is listed as a terrorist organization.","Despite aggressive bombing and sabotage campaign directed mainly against international energy firms and Colombia state oil company Ecopetrol, the ELN has declined from a mid-1990's peak of close to 5,000 fighters to around 2,000 fighters today. As the ELN's then-commander in chief, he travelled to Cuba and remained in exile there after negotiations with the Colombian government failed in 2019.In June 2021, he stepped down from his position as leader of the ELN, citing health reasons, and appointed Eliecer Erlinto Chamorro, alias ""Antonio García,"" as his successor.Barring a change in policy from Colombia concerning the arrests of the ELN leadership, he is unlikely to return from Cuba in the near future.

He was killed in a shootout with Mexican marines in October 2012.","Born in 1974, Lazcano joined the Mexican military in 1991, and became a member of the elite Airbone Special Forces group, known by its Spanish acronym GAFES.He deserted from the military in the late 1990s, and was recruited to work for the Gulf Cartel's security arm, the Zetas. He eventually became the group’s top security strategist.By the time the Zetas broke from the Gulf Cartel in 2010, he was already managing several ""plazas,"" or drug corridors. He was known as one of the most aggressive and ruthless members of the Zetas, an extremely violent group.He was indicted in the District of Columbia, and the United States put a $5 million reward for information leading to his capture.The Zetas reportedly split into two rival factions around July 2012, one headed by Z3 and the other by Miguel Treviño Morales, alias ""Z40."" Reports of Z3's whereabouts during the split placed him outside of Mexico with the faction loyal to him being headed by Ivan Velazquez Caballero, alias ""El Taliban."" El Taliban was captured in San Luis Potosi state on September 26, 2012.Z3 was shot and killed by Mexican security forces on October 7, 2012 in Progreso, Coahuila.","Little was known about Lazcano, who turned his back on opulent displays of wealth and power common among other Mexican drug lords, and kept a low profile.Lazcano did, however, control much of the Zetas' finances, according to Sam Logan, founder of Southern Pulse and author of a recent book on Lazcano and the Zetas, ""The Executioner's Men.""Under Lazcano's command, the Zetas were organized in a cellular structure and low-ranking members know little about overall operations. They engaged in kidnappings, extortion, oil theft, drug trafficking, and also charged ""piso,"" or fees, on drugs transiting their territoryKnown for his cruelty and brutality, Lazcano also earned the nickname ""The Executioner.""","Under Lazcano, the Zetas' operations stretched from the US/Mexico border into Guatemala and Central America. Having operations in at least 10 Mexican states, Lazcano's operations were centered in northeast Mexico.","Beyond having a falling out with Z40, Lazcano and the Zetas were in competition with the Sinaloa Cartel.There were some reports from September 2008 suggesting Lazcano had an agreement of collaboration with the Beltran Leyva brothers and the Juarez Cartel's Vicente Carrillo Fuentes.","Lazcano’s power as a Zetas leader had ebbed in the months before his death, having spent large chunks of his time abroad, according to reports.

Until his capture in 2012, he used a vast network of collaborators, from former paramilitaries to leftist guerrillas, to move cocaine from the country's Eastern Plains to the United States and Europe.","Barrera’s career began in the 1980s when he and his brother Omar Barrera provided chemical precursors to laboratories processing coca base into cocaine hydrochloride in his home state of Guaviare. After Omar was assassinated, Barrera took revenge, and in the process earned the nickname of ""El Loco."" He was captured and jailed by Colombian authorities in 1990, but escaped prison soon afterward. By the mid-1990s he had established himself as a prominent middleman and trafficker, buying semi-processed cocaine from various sources, including commanders of the FARC’s 10th, 14th, 16th and 17th Fronts, and selling it to clients who operated under the umbrella of the powerful Norte del Valle Cartel. Later, he purchased from the FARC’s 43rd Front, controlled by Gener Garcia Molina, alias ""Jhon 40,"" and started selling to Jose Miguel Arroyave, of the Bloque Centauros of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC).However, Barrera was not satisfied with his role as facilitator, and made a series of bold alliances that established him as one of Colombia’s biggest drug traffickers. Sometime around 2004, he joined forces with Manuel de Jesus Piraban, alias ""Jorge Pirata,"" a Bloque Centauros commander, and Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero, alias ""Cuchillo,"" a former hitman turned paramilitary commander for the Centauros Bloc. In September 2004, Barrera, Jorge Pirata and Cuchillo organized the ambush and assassination of the Centauros Bloc's maximum commander, Arroyave. Jorge Pirata turned himself in as part of the peace process between the government and the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), a paramilitary umbrella organization. Meanwhile, Barrera and Cuchillo attacked rivals in the Eastern Plains, driving them from the region.Barrera’s expansion continued in 2008 when, working closely with Luis Enrique Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" and Diego Perez Henao, alias ""Diego Rastrojo,"" he helped engineer the assassination of Wilber Alirio Varela, alias ""Jabon,"" then a major leader of the Norte del Valle Cartel living in Venezuela. Later, he bought routes in the northern province of Atlantico from Miguel Villarreal, alias ""Salomon."" These moves, and Barrera’s ability to co-opt local security officials, left the drug lord with access to and control of trafficking routes from the Pacific ocean and the Venezuelan plains to the Brazilian jungles and the Caribbean coastline.However, Barrera's high profile and ambitious approach to the business eventually got the better of him when, prior to his capture, he began battling other Eastern Plains organizations such as that of Victor Carranza, a powerful emerald dealer and alleged drug trafficker and paramilitary leader, and Hector German Buitrago, alias ""Martin Llanos."" Barrera and his allies ambushed Carranza’s personal caravan on at least two occasions but failed to eliminate him.Starting a feud with Carranza, one of the most venerable underworld figures in Colombia, was just one of several strikes against Barrera, who was already well-known and had many tenuous alliances. The Carranza battle had the potential to make life very difficult for him and his allies, especially the ERPAC. Following the death of ERPAC commander Cuchillo, the military upped the pressure in the Eastern Plains, where both Barrera and ERPAC (now supposedly demobilized) did much of their business. In order to survive long term, Barrera would have needed to develop a plan that included Carranza, and that could have meant turning on his longtime partners in the ERPAC.After the US Southern District Court of Florida announced a new team of prosecutors dedicated primarily to targeting Colombia's new generation of drug gangs, it became clear that Barrera's high profile would continue to create problems for his business. Shortly afterward, the court issued a US indictment for Barrera. In addition, Colombian security forces carried out a series of successful operations targeting Barrera's drug rings. One of these, Operation Deep Water, saw 19 people arrested. Another, Operation Final Flight, saw 30 arrests and 21 aircrafts seized.Barrera also suffered the loss of some of his key contacts. In 2010, emerald trader Julio Alberto Lozano, alias ""Lucho,"" turned himself in to Colombian police and agreed to share intelligence on a network of traffickers which some authorities have called the ""El Dorado"" cartel. Working more like a loosely connected group of businessmen rather than a traditional cartel with security and financial detail, Barrera is said to be a member of this drug trafficking ""board of directors."" Another of Barrera's alleged El Dorado associates, Luis Agustin Caicedo Velandia, alias “Don Lucho,” was arrested in Bueno Aires in June 2010. In February 2012, Ecuadorean authorities arrested Heriberto Fernandez Ramirez, alias ""Beto"", believed to be a key link between Barrera and Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel.Still, Barrera’s history gave him the experience and wherewithal to survive for a long time when others were captured or killed. His strong contacts in Colombia’s establishment and security forces allowed him to run his business and mobilize his forces against enemies.This included contacts in Colombia’s intelligence service (Departamento Administrativo de Seguridad -- DAS), which was disbanded in November 2011. Barrera also allegedly played a significant role in the murder of two top traffickers, which led directly to him taking over some of their drug trafficking operations and routes.However, despite his links with security forces, Loco Barrera was captured in San Cristobal, Venezuela, on 18 September, 2012.","Following his emergence as an independent middleman, Loco Barrera skillfully played the role of mediator, coordinating the purchase of coca base from areas controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and the sale of processed cocaine to groups ranging from paramilitary organizations to the now-defunct Norte del Valle Cartel. In March 2010, the US Treasury Department sanctioned Barrera and named him one of Colombia’s biggest drug traffickers. Two US courts in Florida and New York later indicted him in April and September of that year on drug trafficking charges.At the time of his capture, Barrera was being investigated by Colombian authorities for drug trafficking, money laundering, and homicide.In October 2014, Barrera pleaded guilty in a US court for conspiracy to launder tens of millions of dollars in drug profits.","According to Colombian and foreign counternarcotics officials, Barrera operated in the Eastern Plains, principally the provinces of Meta, Vichada, Casanare and Guaviare. He also controlled strategic parts of Colombia’s capital, Bogota, and had consolidated staging areas in the Apure state of Venezuela from where he sent aircraft full of drugs to the Caribbean and Central America. Barrera himself was alleged to operate in the Vichada province of Colombia and in parts of Venezuela, where he allegedly had the protection of local officials. Barrera also used Venezuela as a storage and staging point to send drugs to Europe. He also used West Africa as a transit point for drugs shipped to Europe.Intelligence sources told InSight Crime that in the years leading up to his arrest, he spent most of his time in Venezuela in order to have more security against prosecution and extradition.","Barrera succeeded in bringing seemingly disparate political forces together for business purposes. By the end of the 1990s, he’d established strong contacts with the FARC, often selling coca base to the rebels’ paramilitary rivals in the AUC or processing the coca himself for sale on the international market. His alliances with Cuchillo in the early part of the 2000s and with Comba in the latter part of the same decade put Barrera among the most formidable of Colombian traffickers. He also had contacts with numerous other criminal groups like Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel. These alliances gave him a measure of protection from his rivals, which included some of Colombia’s most storied drug traffickers.One of these alliances was with another major Colombian drug trafficker known as Don Lucho. Colombia’s Attorney General’s Office said that Don Lucho and Barrera worked together to traffic cocaine internationally. Other US anti-drug officials, however, believe that Don Lucho and El Loco each had their own sophisticated trafficking networks that worked beside one another while respecting each other’s operations. This raised questions over Barrera’s actual role in the Colombian underworld, where he had long been considered one of, if not the most, powerful remaining drug lords.However, although Barrera was known to work with Don Lucho, and likely performed some security jobs for him, evidence shows that he was almost certainly a powerful drug trafficker in his own right who managed his own profitable cocaine business separate from his connections with Don Lucho. According to information from confidential informants in the indictments against him, Barrera moved up to 400 tons of cocaine per year between 1998 and 2010, earning hundreds of millions of dollars of drug proceeds along the way.","Two months after his capture in Venezuela, Barrera was deported to Colombia in November 2012. The following year, Colombia’s then-President Juan Manuel Santos approved his extradition to the United States. In 2014, Barrera pleaded guilty in a US federal court to conspiring to launder tens of millions of dollars in drug money, as well as to drug trafficking charges.In July 2016, Barrera was sentenced to 35 years in prison for his role in the cocaine trafficking conspiracy."

When Zetas commander Arturo Guzman Decena was killed in 2002, he rose through the ranks.In July 2012, the Zetas reportedly split into two factions, one side headed by Z40, the other by Heriberto Lazcano, alias ""Z3."" The rival capos each accused the other of betrayal and became embroiled in a bitter and violent power struggle. In October 2012, Mexican security forces reported shooting and killing Z3, leaving Treviño as the most senior Zetas commander. In October 2012, a Zetas splinter group comprised of opponents of Z40 announced they had formed a new group, Los Legionarios (the Legionaries), with the express purpose of waging war against Z40 and his organization.Treviño worked to consolidate his hold over his Zetas. However, he was captured in July 2013 in Anahuac, a town southwest of Nuevo Laredo.","Around 2007, Z40 was sent to Veracruz following the death of a high-ranking member of the group. He took control of that drug trafficking corridor, while simultaneously taking over other illicit industries such as trade in pirated DVDs and CDs, and human trafficking.Several of his family members also became involved in crime. His brother and uncle laundered money on the Zetas' behalf in the United States, using a horse-breeding company as a cover-up. They were captured after a raid on US territory in 2012.In 2021, a new Netflix series, “Somos.,” (We Are), shed light on the 2011 Allende massacre in Coahuila, which killed up to 300 people, and was reportedly ordered by Z40 and his brother, Alejandro ""Omar"" Treviño Morales, alias ""Z42."" ","Z40 was once the ""plaza"" boss in Nuevo Laredo, the Zetas’ longtime base of operations. He is also thought to have run the Zetas' operations in Guatemala, where the group had established bases in the northern states of Peten and Alta Verapaz.","A Zetas splinter group known as the Legionaries was created in 2012 with the mission of killing Z40 and those aligned with him. The Zetas have also made enemies with several other criminal groups, as they rely on collecting “piso,” or a tax, from other underworld organizations. The Zetas' two most prominent rivalries are with their progenitor, the Gulf Cartel, and the Sinaloa Cartel.","At the time, Z40's capture was the most important since President Enrique Peña Nieto took office in December 2012.

He soon caught the attention of Wilber Varela, one of the leaders of the NDVC. When Varela began a war with a rival member of the NDVC, Diego Montoya, alias ""Don Diego,"" he turned to Perez to set up a private army and named it after his underworld alias, ""Rastrojo."" In 2002 the Rastrojos were born and Perez led the war against Montoya's private army, called the ""Machos,"" a war which he ended up winning.The other rising star in Varela's organization was Javier Calle Serna, alias ""Comba."" Perez supported Comba when he killed Varela in 2008 and took command of the whole organization, which then became known to all as the Rastrojos.Perez was instrumental in the expansion of the Rastrojos from 2008 onwards, sending out heavily armed cells to different parts of the country, in order to secure access to drug crops, protect cocaine laboratories and control internal movement corridors within Colombia. Until recently, the Rastrojos were one of Colombia's most powerful drug trafficking organizations.Rumors surfaced of Perez' arrest in January 2011 in Venezuela, but they quickly proved false. He always maintained a very low profile, and very little was known about him. He was believed to be continuously on the move, both inside and outside of Colombia. He maintained direct command over many of the different Rastrojos units across the country, and took a direct hand in fighting, and eliminating, rivals.With the surrender of Comba to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on May 8, 2012, Perez was the favorite to assume overall command of the Rastrojos until his capture that June in Venezuela and subsequent extradition to the United States on drug trafficking charges. In 2014, he was give a 30-year sentence.","In August 2014, Perez pleaded guilty in a US court to trafficking over 80,000 kilos of cocaine between 1994 and 2008. Colombian authorities have also charged Perez of committing 66 homicides in the southwest department of Valle del Cauca. The US Treasury Deparment designated Perez to its drug ""kingpin"" list in January 2013.","The Rastrojos' initial zone of influence was along the Pacific Coast in the provinces of Cauca and Valle del Cauca. In 2006 they began to expand into Colombia's coffee-growing region as well as the northern department of La Guajira, located along to the Venezuelan border. At one point, the Rastrojos were believed to have a presence in more than 10 of Colombia's 32 departments.","Perez personally negotiated an alliance with rebels of the National Liberation Army (ELN) in the provinces of Cauca and Nariño on the Pacific coast. This later developed into a nationwide alliance in the interests of drug trafficking, with the ELN selling coca base to the Rastrojos in not only Cauca and Nariño, but also Antioquia, Choco, Bolivar and Norte de Santander.The Rastrojos have also worked closely with international partners, such as the Sinaloa Cartel, sending drug shipments from Colombia to Central America and Mexico, bound for the United States.The Rastrojos' main rival is the Urabeños. The two criminal groups agreed to a truce in late 2011, but this was short-lived, as the Rastrojos began to fall apart soon after. Violent confrontations between these criminal organizations in the Venezuela-Colombia border region were reported as recently as November 2014.","Perez was sentenced to 30 years in prison on August 6, 2014. Perez's capture and sentencing, coupled with the captures and surrenders of the rest of the top leadership in 2012, has likely spelled the end for the Rastrojos as a national criminal organization."

He surrendered to US authorities in Panama on October 2, 2012, and was sentenced to nine years in prison by a US court on February 10, 2017.","Calle Serna was a top leader of the Rastrojos criminal syndicate in Colombia, perhaps the country’s most ambitious and sophisticated drug trafficking organization. His older brother, Javier Antonio Calle Serna, alias 'Comba' was the top leader of the Rastrojos until handing himself over to the US in May 2012 and some say Luis may have ridden his coat tails into the Colombian underworld. Still, with experience overseeing cocaine laboratories along the Pacific Coast and connections to Mexican drug cartels, in particular the powerful Sinaloa Cartel, he commanded respect. He is a trained pilot.After reportedly negotiating his surrender for months with the United States, he handed himself over on October 2, 2012 in Panama. He was eventually sentenced to nine years in prison by a New York court as part of a plea deal in February 2017.","Calle Serna was a leader of the Rastrojos, which until recently was one of Colombia's largest drug trafficking organizations. The Rastrojos are also involved in extortion and kidnapping, as well as illegal mining.",Calle Serna kept a low profile and was believed to have operated out of Ecuador and along the Pacific Coast in Colombia where much of the Rastrojos’ operations are based. He had been living in Venezuela immediately prior to his arrest.,"Calle Serna worked closely with his brother, Comba, to establish the Rastrojos as one of Colombia's most powerful drug trafficking organizations. However, shortly before their arrest, the Calle Serna brothers were reportedly at odds with Diego Rastrojo over whether or not to turn themselves, creating two competing factions within the criminal organization.","Since Calle Serna has been in US custody since 2012, he could be released as early as 2020. But his freedom may be short lived, as the United States will deport him back to Colombia where he is expected face charges of criminal association and drug trafficking."
"Guillermo Leon Saenz Vargas, alias 'Alfonso Cano'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/guillermo-leon-saenz-vargas-alfonso-cano/,Guillermo Leon Saenz Vargas,Alfonso Cano,./images/individuals/guillermo-leon-saenz-vargas.jpg,2017-03-10,"['alfonso cano', 'colombia personalities', 'farc']",colombia,"Guillermo Leon Saenz Vargas, alias Alfonso Cano, was the supreme commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the hemisphere's oldest and deadliest insurgency. He was killed on November 4, 2011.","Alfonso Cano became the commander of the FARC after the rebels' long time leader, alias ""Manuel Marulanda,"" died of natural causes in 2008. Cano had been in the FARC since 1982, where he spent most of his time as the political leader of the Western Bloc (Bloque Occidental). He was well known within the organization for his communist ideals and hard revolutionary line, although many of his cohorts scoffed at his scant military experience. After assuming the leadership of the FARC, he spent millions of dollars on weapons and tried to shift the guerrillas' tactics in response to the government's military offensive that has pushed the FARC to the fringes of the country and into neighboring states. This has resulted in the use of more landmines to keep the military at bay and car bombs to keep them off-guard.Alfonso Cano was more political ideologue than military tactician. An anthropologist who studied at the National University in Bogota, Cano began his FARC career in the early 1980s as an emissary of the Communist Party. From the beginning he had close ties with the rebels' then political commander, Luis Morantes, alias ""Jacobo Arenas,"" who fast-tracked him to the guerrillas' central command, the Secretariat. Following Morantes' death in 1990, Cano became the FARC's top political emissary. In 2000, he launched the Bolivarian Movement for a New Colombia (Movimiento Bolivariano por la Nueva Colombia), a clandestine political party. He was also in charge of the Colombian Clandestine Communist Party (Partido Comunista Clandestino Colombiano - PC3).Alfonso Cano's emergence as the maximum FARC commander helped give credence to the notion that the guerrillas were open to a negotiated settlement. He participated as a political representative of the FARC in the 1991 Caracas peace negotiations and in the Tlaxcala Peace Dialogues in 1992. During the Caguan Peace Dialogues with Andres Pastrana's government between 1999-2002, however, he had a lower profile and actively looked for members for the Bolivarian Movement. After the negotiations failed in 2002, Cano led an operation in which 12 Valle del Cauca politicians were kidnapped. The guerrillas later executed most of the politicians.Alfonso Cano also became known as a hardliner inside the guerrillas. He has been accused of executing some 40 rebel soldiers for insubordination. He was also accused of murdering Guillermo Gaviria, a former governor of Antioquia along with former minister Gilberto Echeverri and eight members of the military in 2003, when the army tried to rescue the two politicians who had been kidnapped.Despite his lack of military credentials, the FARC leader successfully implemented an aggressive strategy that emphasized hit-and-run ambushes, known as the ""Rebirth Plan"" (Plan Renacer) and the near exclusive targeting of the security forces, known as ""Plan Pistola."" In 2009 and 2010, this allowed the FARC to inflict nearly as many military and police casualties as seen at the height of their power. Under Alfonso Cano's watch, the FARC also increased their overall number of actions, carrying out some 1,600 attacks in 2010, according to think-tank Nuevo Arco Iris. At the beginning of 2011, Cano vowed to ""double"" the FARC's attacks in a video released to the media.","Cano was wanted in the United States on drug trafficking charges, and the US State Department had offered $5 million for his capture. He was also involved in high-profile kidnappings and was allegedly responsible for the execution of some kidnapping victims.","Cano served as the political leader of the FARC's Western Bloc and operated mainly in the Tolima, Huila and Cauca provinces.","The FARC have alliances with both the National Liberation Army (ELN) and criminal groups known as BACRIM (from the Spanish for ""criminal bands""). The FARC have engaged in joint military operations with the ELN and some FARC fronts collaborate with BACRIM in the drug trade.","The FARC made an apparent gesture of political goodwill when they released five political hostages early in 2011, but accompanying the release was a wave of bombings and ambushes, just as Alfonso Cano had promised. President Juan Manuel Santos then made it clear that the government's top priority was killing the FARC's top commander, when he announced in February 2011 that the armed forces were ""breathing down his neck."" The army created a new joint task force dedicated to pressuring Cano in the mountainous Tolima, Huila and Cauca provinces. The strategy led to an intensification of the conflict in these regions, especially Cauca, as guerrilla fronts launched bold attacks against the security forces, partly to distract the army's attention from Cano's movements.After the deaths of two of his top security officials, it became clear that the circle around Cano was tightening. He narrowly avoided capture in July 2011, and began traveling in a small group of just 12 bodyguards. He was finally killed on November 4, 2011. "
"Javier Antonio Calle Serna, alias 'Comba'",https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/javier-antonio-calle-serna-comba/,Javier Antonio Calle Serna,Comba,./images/individuals/javier-antonio-calle-serna.jpg,2017-03-10,"['colombia personalities', 'comba', 'rastrojos']",colombia,"Javier Antonio Calle Serna, alias “Comba,” was the top leader of the Rastrojos, a group of former paramilitary hitmen turned drug trafficking organization in Colombia. He surrendered to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on May 8, 2012.","Calle Serna began his criminal career as a fighter for the Popular Liberation Army (EPL) in the southern department of Putumayo. When the rebel group demobilized in 1991 as part of the peace process, he moved northward to the city of Cali, in Valle del Cauca. There he established himself as an assassin and enforcer, and worked for several different drug traffickers, coming to the attention of Wilber Varela, alias ""Jabon,"" then a leader of the Norte del Valle Cartel.Over time Calle Serna gained Varela’s trust, and eventually became his top assistant, running much of the financial network and international contacts for the cartel. While working with the Norte del Valle organization, Javier became acquainted with Diego Perez Henao, alias “Diego Rastrojo.” The two developed a close and lasting relationship, with Perez managing the rural security structure for the Rastrojos up until his capture in June 2012.After a conflict broke out between Calle Serna and Varela in January 2008, he had Varela killed in Merida, Venezuela, with the help of Perez and possibly Daniel Barrera, alias ""El Loco.”In 2011, rumors surfaced that Javier and his brother Luis, also a Rastrojos leader, were on the verge of handing themselves over to U.S. authorities. Along with nine other members of the Rastrojos (all of whom have already been arrested in Colombia), Calle Serna was indicted by the Eastern District of New York in June 2011 on drug trafficking charges.This tightening net, combined with the inroads that the rival Urabeños were making into Rastrojos turf in Antioquia, Cordoba and along the Pacific Coast, meant that Comba found himself increasingly under pressure. President Juan Manuel Santos confirmed in early 2012 that Javier Calle Serna was in talks with US authorities about turning himself in. His brother, Juan Carlos, was arrested in Ecuador in March 2012, another sign that the ring was tightening around the Calle Sernas. Rumors of Comba's surrender intensified during the first half of 2012, before he finally turned himself in to US authorities and was shipped to New York on May 8, 2012.The Rastrojos have been weakened since the fall of Javier Calle Serna and his brother, as well as the arrest and subsequent extradition to the United States of Perez. However, though their national leadership has been taken out, they continue to operate in smaller, localized cells in their traditional strongholds.","Comba is facing charges for drug trafficking, money laundering, and murder in the United States. In June 2011, the US Treasury Department added Comba to its drug ""kingpin"" list.","Calle Serna began fighting in the southern department of Putumayo with the EPL. He later moved to Cali, where he worked as a member of the NDVC and later a top commander of the Rastrojos, whose main base of operations is in Colombia's Pacific coastal region.","Calle Serna became a top assistant to his former boss, Wilber Varela, alias ""Jabon,"" a leader of the NDVC. However the two had a falling out in 2008, and Calle Serna ordered Varela to be killed in Venezuela. Calle Serna maintained a working relationship with fellow Rastrojos leader, Diego Rastrojo, however the two disagreed on whether or not to turn themselves in to authorities. This disagreement created competing factions within the Rastrojos, one led by the Calle Serna brothers and the other by Diego Rastrojo.","It is highly possible Calle Serna will receive a reduced sentence in the United States, since he was quick to hand himself over to authorities in 2012. Calle Serna also reportedly gave up 64 properties in 2014 in return for a lighter sentence for him and his brother, and it is rumored he will receive 15 years behind bars."
