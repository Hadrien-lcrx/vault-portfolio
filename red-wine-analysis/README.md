## Introduction

This is an Exploratory Data Analysis of a red wine dataset obtained [here](https://onlinecourses.science.psu.edu/stat857/node/223).
All the necessary information about the dataset can be obtained [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/wineQualityInfo.txt).

This analysis was conducted in R and tries to **predict the quality of a red wine based on its chemical features**.
