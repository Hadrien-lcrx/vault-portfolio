Carlos Capa Gang,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/carlos-capa-gang/,Carlos Capa Gang,,./images/organizations/carlos-capa-gang.jpg,2023-01-27,"['megabandas', 'venezuela', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"The Carlos Capa gang, which is named for the alias of its leader Deiber Johan González, is one of the oldest surviving criminal gangs in Valles del Tuy, a strategic region located south of Caracas, in the state of Miranda.The group rose to fame in a violent region characterized by the proliferation of many small gangs, among which it has stood out for its ability to build alliances and eliminate rivals when necessary. This, added to the support it receives form local communities and its ability to hide in mountainous areas, have allowed it to elude attacks by security forces for more than a decade.","Carlos Capa grew up in San Francisco de Yare, capital of the municipality of Simón Bolívar, in the heart of Valles del Tuy. It did not take long before he was taking his first steps in a life of crime. Since 2009, he has been charged with homicide and the illegal possession of firearms and drugs, according to the records of Venezuela's criminal investigation unit (Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas – CICPC).In his early days, the would-be leader built his power by associating with other criminals. After forming a gang called the Rompe, he established alliances with Haisel Javier Rivas Tovar, alias “Diente de Oro,” a major criminal leader from San Francisco de Yare, as well as with Kelvin Saúl Yánez Muñoz, alias “Saulito.” Saulito, the son of Saúl Yánez, who was elected Simón Bolivar’s mayor in 2008, would later join with Capa to form their own gang.In July 2015, Yánez Jr. was assassinated while celebrating his birthday party at a home in San Francisco de Yare in an attack allegedly ordered by Carlos Capa and Diente de Oro. Later that year, Diente de Oro died in a confrontation with CICPC officials, leaving Carlos Capa as the group’s sole leader.After the death of his son, in August 2015, mayor Yánez supported the Operation for the Liberation of the People (OLP) in San Francisco de Yare and its surroundings, which targeted the Carlos Capa gang. Nearly 500 officials were deployed, and at least three members of the gang were arrested, although Capa managed to escape.This marked the beginning of a series of major operations against the group, which have continued to the present day. In September 2022, after Capa was supposedly responsible for the assassination of a local police officer, nearly 900 security officials took part in Operation Thunder IV, which led to the deaths of several alleged criminals and dozens of arrests.Security forces managed to arrest and kill several lieutenants and other members of the gang during such operations, but Carlos Capa has shown significant resilience in the face of these blows.Despite police pressure, Carlos Capa's gang has consolidated in San Francisco de Yare, and, by allying with other gangs and assassinating criminals leaders who have opposed it, has expanded its criminal domain to other areas of Valles del Tuy, such as Ocumare del Tuy.","Carlos Capa's leadership within his group is unquestionable. He represents a unique example of longevity among the Valles de Tuy’s criminal leaders, managing to evade the actions of the security forces for years and avoiding being dethroned by his own men. Capa has survived thanks in part to his ability to form alliances with other criminal leaders, but also by acting ruthlessly to eliminate his rivals, as evidenced by videos he has published of the executions of his enemies. The death of Saulito established a clear warning for those who tried to dispute his power within the gang.In recent years, several of Carlos Capa's lieutenants have been detained or killed by security forces. While this has weakened the gang, it has also prevented the rise of internal commanders who may have been able to challenge Capa's power.","As a result of his strong ties to the community and the consolidation of his criminal leadership, Carlos Capa exercises extensive control in various sectors of the Valles del Tuy subregion, especially in the municipalities of Simón Bolívar and Lander, but also in Cristóbal Rojas and Independencia.Carlos Capa regularly uses cambuches (makeshift homes) in the mountainous areas between San Francisco de Yare and Ocumare del Tuy to hide or flee from his criminal rivals and security forces. This has been a key factor in how he has avoided being captured or killed by the authorities.","One of the main forms of income of the Carlos Capa gang is the collection of extortion payments from merchants, agricultural and industrial producers, and companies that carry out construction work in the territories it controls. Various sources indicate that members of the gang also extort the Local Supply and Production Committees (Comités Locales de Alimentos y Producción – CLAP), which distribute boxes of subsidized food, taking a percentage of the products to later resell or to use themselves.The gang is also behind many of the scams through Facebook's Marketplace platform. There, they lure victims to Valles del Tuy using fraudulent promises of second-hand vehicles for sale below the market price. Once the victims arrive, the gang members rob them and kidnap them until their relatives or relatives pay a ransom. Those who resist pay with their lives.Homicides against criminal rivals, police officers, and civilians are also commonly committed by the gang, as are thefts of vehicles and other property.To achieve their nefarious ends, the gang employs a large arsenal of weapons that includes rifles and grenades.","Over the years, members of the Carlos Capa gang have assassinated several police officers, which has caused security forces to intensify the operations against them. Capa himself is considered one of the most-wanted criminals in the state of Miranda.Despite this, the group has recruited important police officials as allies. During the execution of Operation Thunder IV, Simón Bolívar police director Patricia Eliana Rodríguez López and Osmer Israel González Suárez, the chief of police operations of the municipality of Urdaneta in Miranda, were both arrested for their links to the gang.The media has reported that Capa is an ally of the Tren de Aragua, the most powerful criminal gang in Venezuela. In September 2017, Carlos Capa is believed to have held a meeting with members of the Tren de Aragua. However, the nature of this alliance and whether it is still active is unknown. Carlos Capa has also established alliances with small gangs from San Francisco de Yare and Ocumare del Tuy, which have been of vital importance to his operations and survival.","Despite successful operations against other gangs in Valles del Tuy, Venezuelan authorities have failed to neutralize Carlos Capa's criminal group. The leader has important ties to members of the communities where he operates, uses mountainous areas to hide, and has also established relationships with local police officials, which has allowed him to evade the authorities' actions against him."
The R Organization,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/the-r-organization/,The R Organization,,./images/organizations/the-r-organization.jpg,2023-01-26,"['illegal mining', 'venezuela', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"The R Organization (Organización R – OR) is one of Bolívar state's fastest-growing mining gangs, often called sindicatos. Over the last several years, it has expanded its control over valuable gold mines, sometimes through violent conflict with rival gangs. The gang's meteoric rise to power was driven not only by its armed strength, but also by its ability to secure the support of local communities through social outreach.","The R Organization evolved from a gang first created around 2008 in Ciudad Guayana in northern Venezuela. Since its early days, it has been led by Eduardo José Natera Balboa, alias ""Run"" or ""El Pelón."" The gang was initially involved in robberies, murders, and weapons theft.Run and his gang eventually moved into more profitable criminal economies -- especially illegal gold mining – and reports of their presence in mining zones around Bolívar began in 2019. The gang successfully established itself in the town of Tumeremo and blended its criminal activities with social work and political action, which helped it gain local community support. Members of the gang have gone as far as to describe the group as a defender of the rights of informal miners.The OR won the support of residents of Tumeremo and surrounding areas by setting up a charitable wing known as the 3Rs Foundation (Fundación de Gestión Social Integral 3R). It reportedly provides food, public services, and healthcare to residents of Tumeremo, as well as organizing sporting activities.Even though the 3Rs Foundation denies its connection to the OR, a member of the gang told Insight Crime that the two are, in fact, the same. The OR has also released a statement professing its support of the foundation.In addition to locals' acceptance of the gang, its strategic recruitment appears to have helped it strengthen so quickly. A local politician reported that the OR recruited from the remnants of a gang that previously controlled Tumeremo. And a senior state government official, who spoke to InSight Crime on the condition of anonymity, claimed that the group also recruited deserters from the Venezuelan military.As the OR's power grew, it was able to challenge security forces in the region and dispute control over the mines. In April 2021, the gang ambushed and killed Lieutenant Colonel Ernesto Solís, who had targeted the gang. This was a turning point for the OR, after which its strength grew exponentially.As it continued to expand, the OR once again clashed with Tren de Guayana in 2021, seeking to displace the rival sindicato from mining areas in El Callao and Guasipati. After several months of fighting, the two sides agreed to a ceasefire, with, according to the gang's own statement, the help of the Venezuelan Mining Corporation (Corporación Venezolana de Minería – CVM), a government agency that oversees mining activities and manages some contracts with small-scale miners and multinational corporations.For the first part of 2022, the group could operate relatively easily throughout Tumeremo. That changed in late October when the military deployed Operation Roraima 2022 throughout Bolívar's mining region. The OR appears to have been the main target of these operations, throwing its continued dominance in Tumeremo into question.","The OR was founded by Eduardo José Natera Balboa, alias ""Run"" or ""el Pelón,"" who remains its principal leader today.In 2009, Run was sentenced to 14 years in the El Dorado Penitentiary Center in the Sifontes municipality. But early into his sentence, he was reported missing from prison, with some media outlets claiming that he had escaped.His whereabouts remained unknown for years, although by 2014, he had become one of the most wanted criminals in Ciudad Guayana after he claimed responsibility for the death of rival gang leader Yorman Pedro Márquez Rodríguez, alias ""El Gordo Bayón,"" of the Tren de Guayana gang.Run successfully moved into the mining areas in Tumeremo alongside his lieutenants, including César Alexander González, alias ""El Mágico González.""","The R Organization maintains a permanent presence in the urban center of Tumeremo and its surrounding gold mines, especially those known as Belén, Tomi, and La Increíble.In Tumeremo, they assert harsh rules over the community, claiming that they are providing security. Recent military operations also seized surveillance drones, which they claimed that the OR used to monitor the area's population.The OR's attempts to expand into some of El Callao's mines in 2021 led to conflicts with Tren de Guayana, and the group has so far been unable to assert total dominance over the neighboring municipality.","The R Organization benefits from its control of mining areas by collecting extortion fees called ""vacunas"" at most stages of gold production in the region, much like other mining sindicatos. However, the gang itself and some residents of Tumeremo claim that the OR's vacunas are lower than those charged by other groups.Some press reports claim that the OR is also involved in the local distribution of drugs, including cocaine and marijuana.","The R Organization claims that it does not have ties to the Venezuelan military, with one member dubbing Run ""the Rebel of the South."" However, there are some indications that the group is interested in expanding its political influence via the 3Rs Foundation.The 3Rs Foundation has worked with the Movement for Peace and Life (Movimiento por la Paz y la Vida), a national government program led by Alexander ""Mimou"" Vargas, the former vice minister for sport and a former representative to the National Assembly. According to the social media accounts of the 3Rs Foundation, Vargas has participated in the foundation's events and shown support to the 3Rs Foundation. However, there is no evidence that Vargas has direct links to the R Organization's criminal activities.The group has also coopted the local branch of the Venezuelan Popular Unity political party (Unidad Popular Venezolana – UPV), even supporting the mayoral campaign of the party's candidate in 2021. However, the candidate was removed from the ballot before the election.While local sources have repeated rumors that the OR maintains relationships with corrupt local military officials, Operation Roraima's efforts to target the group suggest that this is not enough to protect them from large-scale operations conducted by forces coordinated by a national command.The OR has also built alliances with nearby gangs in Sifontes, including the Sindicato of Las Claritas and Negro Fabio's gang in El Dorado, according to security and underworld sources who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. These three groups have apparently agreed to respect each other's territory, in contrast to the OR's long-running rivalry with Tren de Guayana, which has led to violence on multiple occasions.","While the R Organization is considered by many to be one of the strongest mining sindicatos in Bolívar, the late 2022 deployment of Operation Roraima involved over 1,000 soldiers and heavily targeted the group in its stronghold of Tumeremo. Unlike the previous military deployment in August 2022, which sources largely denounced as a sham with no effect on the group, these appear to have had more success, leaving the group's future in Tumeremo's mines unclear. However, as of yet, they have largely left the group's leadership structure intact. And if the military cannot maintain long-term control over the area, the OR could use its military strength and ties to local communities to reassert itself."
Tren de Guayana,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/tren-de-guayana/,Tren de Guayana,,./images/organizations/tren-de-guayana.jpg,2021-01-26,"['venezuela', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"Tren de Guayana is one of the most powerful mining gangs known as sindicatos that jockey to control gold mines in the southern Venezuelan state of Bolívar. Despite bloody conflicts with rival gangs and state forces, for over a decade, the sindicato has managed to hold on to key territories where it can control and profit from small-scale miners' activities and the illegal gold trade.","Tren de Guayana began operating as an urban gang in the Vista al Sol neighborhood of San Félix, the old town of Ciudad Guayana, around 2007. The group was initially led by Yorman Pedro Márquez Rodríguez, alias ""El Gordo Bayón."" Under his leadership, the gang gained notoriety throughout San Félix and began taking control of mining zones in the Roscio municipality, which lies to the city's southeast. Bolívar state authorities allegedly sponsored Tren de Guayana's expansion into mining zones. Two former security officials turned whistleblowers claimed the gang enjoyed political patronage from officials, including then-Governor of Bolívar Francisco Rangel Gómez and his secretary of public security, Julio César Fuentes Manzulli. In June 2014, Gordo Bayón was assassinated, reportedly by gang leader Eduardo Natera, alias ""El Pelón Natera"" or ""Run,"" who now leads rival sindicato, the R Organization (Organización R – OR). Leadership passed smoothly to Vladimir Sanclemente Ojedo, alias ""El Capitán,"" and Tren de Guayana continued to expand, taking control over mining territories in the Sifontes and El Callao municipalities.  But starting in 2017, Tren de Guayana began to lose ground. Whatever political protection the group had once enjoyed was withdrawn. It was targeted in a significant anti-gang crackdown, which forced the sindicato out of some of the mines it controlled in Sifontes. Then, in June 2018, El Capitán was included on a list of high-priority targets when the government launched Operation Metal Hands (Operación Manos de Metal), a campaign to crack down on mining gangs and control the gold trade. He was killed in a confrontation with security forces just four months later. Ronny Colome Cruz Yackson, alias ""Ronny Matón,"" then took charge, making a violent name for the sindicato as he fought to maintain its control over gold mines. The OR once again threatened Tren de Guayana in 2021 when it launched a violent campaign to take over mines in El Callao and Roscio. The two groups brokered a truce later that year, but the region remains volatile. ","Tren de Guayana likely receives most of its income from its activities in Bolívar's gold mines, although there is little evidence that gang members mine the gold themselves. Instead, sources in mines under Tren de Guayana's control say, the gang extorts local miners and, in some cases, demands a cut of the gold and gold ore produced. The group has also long extorted local vendors in the markets of San Félix. ","Ronny Matón has led Tren de Guayana since 2018. Press reports link Ronny Matón with the gang's original leaders as early as 2012, making him a natural successor. Under his leadership, the gang has fought to maintain operations in both urban and mining areas, with trusted ""lieutenants"" overseeing the gang's activities in different territories. ","Tren de Guayana maintains a permanent presence in both urban neighborhoods and rural mining zones in Bolívar. In the Caroní municipality, the group has fought to maintain its control over San Félix's markets and still has a presence in the Vista al Sol neighborhood, where the gang originated. The group's expansion into the illegal mining sectors of the Roscio and El Callao municipalities accounts for much of their income. Tren de Guayana is the dominant actor in Roscio's sector of Guasipati, especially the Cicapra and Vainitas mines. The group is also reported to maintain a presence in some of El Callao's mines, but the extent of their control remains unclear as state forces and rival criminal groups dispute the area. ","Although the political clout of Tren de Guayana appears to have diminished since the end of Rangel Gómez's governorship, multiple sources that spoke to InSight Crime and press reports suggest that the group works closely with corrupt sectors of the military and security forces, claims that have been repeated by the group's rivals. These connections, however, appear to be alliances of convenience that are liable to break down. In late 2022, the security deployment Operation Roraima targeted the gang in both El Callao and Roscio. However, Tren de Guayana does not appear to have any significant criminal allies, clashing with other gangs that operate in or near its territories. Tren de Guayana's rivalry with Run and the R Organization stretches back years and only seems to have intensified as both Run and Tren de Guayana have expanded into mining territories. Despite the truce that ended the two groups' latest round of fighting, shortly after the agreement was struck, a member of the OR told InSight Crime that the two groups remain enemies. The gang has also had a long-running conflict over mines in El Callao with the Sindicato of El Perú since at least 2014. Tensions flared up in 2017 and 2019, and again in early 2022. ","Tren de Guayana's territorial control has fluctuated greatly since its early days. Although it has declined since the peak of its powers prior to the security forces operations of 2017, it is still considered one of the strongest mining gangs in Bolívar. Previously its alleged alliances with security forces have helped it weather attacks by rivals. Still, security operations targeting the group in late 2022 suggest it may no longer be able to count on this support, leaving the group more vulnerable than before. "
Lobos,https://insightcrime.org/ecuador-organized-crime-news/lobos-ecuador/,Lobos,,./images/organizations/lobos.jpg,2022-11-08,"['ecuador', 'ecuador groups']",ecuador,"The Lobos have emerged as Ecuador's second-largest mega-gang, with over 8,000 members spread throughout Ecuador's prisons. The group has been involved in several devastating prison massacres in the country, which killed over 315 inmates in 2021 alone.The deteriorating standing of the Choneros as the predominant criminal organization in Ecuador has left room for the Lobos to take control of a powerful gang federation that includes the Tiguerones and Chone Killers and to vie for control of Ecuador's prisons from where the nation drug trade, connected to Colombian and Mexican organized crime groups, is directed.","Like many of Ecuador's gangs, the Lobos began as a splinter group of Ecuador's most prominent criminal group, the Choneros. The Choneros' principal rivals had been the Cubanos and the Lagartos, both significant prison gangs. But the deaths of both gangs' leaders dealt a heavy blow to the organizations' capabilities. Then, the 2020 assassination of Choneros leader Jorge Luis Zambrano, alias ""Rasquiña,"" left a vacuum in the leadership of Ecuador's dominant criminal organization. Recognizing the weakened position of the Choneros, several gangs and factions previously allied with the larger group broke ranks and forged a new alliance to battle the debilitated mega-gang. These smaller groups include the Lobos, the Chone Killers, and the Tiguerones. They refer to themselves collectively as the Nueva Generación (New Generation) in reference to their alleged but unproven links with Mexico's Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación - CJNG). According to reports, the Lobos and its allies have provided security and arms to CJNG since 2016, while the Choneros do the same for Mexico's other major criminal group, the Sinaloa Cartel. This battle for control of Ecuador's cocaine trafficking routes is driving much of the country's violence.In February 2021, Nueva Generación launched coordinated attacks against the Choneros' fragmented leadership, targeting Rasquiña's two potential successors, alias ""JR"" and alias ""Fito,"" during prison riots. Both managed to survive, but the riots left 80 other inmates dead.In a significant escalation of violence, 119 prisoners were killed in prison riots in September 2021 as the Choneros, and the Lobos confronted each other at Guayaquil Litoral prison in southern Ecuador. The same year, authorities seized scores of heavy-caliber weapons in prisons controlled by the Choneros, the Lobos, and Lagartos, indicating an increased flow of weapons was entering Ecuador and ending up in the country's prisons.In November 2021, Ecuadorian officials blamed the Sinaloa Cartel and the CJNG for supporting the Choneros and Nueva Generación and supplying them with weapons ahead of multiple days of prison riots in which 68 inmates perished.The violence has continued unabated throughout 2022. In April, riots broke out in the Turi prison near the southern city of Cuenca and claimed 20 lives. Alexander Quesada, alias ""Ariel,"" leader of the Lobos and Marcelo Anchundia, leader of a smaller rival gang, the R7, were reportedly behind the violence. The R7 had initially supported the Lobos but broke away following the souring of the leaders' relationship.Following the Turi riots, both Ariel and Anchundia requested transfers. They were both moved to a maximum-security prison in Guayaquil but continued to receive threats against their lives. Anchundia was moved to Bellavista prison in Santo Domingo de Los Tsáchilas, close to Quito. Ariel ordered another attempt on his rival's life, leading to riots at Bellavista and the deaths of 44 prisoners.Then, in November, the Lobos and their allies, the Tiguerones, were reportedly behind a wave of violence across the country, which saw police officers being killed, car bombs being set off, and bodies left hanging from bridges. These attacks were sparked by the gangs having many of their members transferred out of Guayaquil's Litoral prison, which, they feared, would result in a loss of criminal control and income. The two gangs issued pamphlets warning of brutal reprisals if the transfers continued.","According to the Ecuadorian newspaper GK, the Lobo's leader was Wilmer Chavarría, alias ""Pipo,"" who operated from the Turi prison in Cuenca. Police believe that Pipo was killed in a 2021 prison riot in which 34 inmates were murdered, though this has never been proven, GK reported.Since Pipo's alleged death, Alexander Quesada, alias ""Ariel,"" is widely considered the gang's leader. Ariel has been described as having an aggressive demeanor, which purportedly sparked his feud with Anchundia, leader of the R7 gang. Given his role, Ariel presumably influences the Tiguerones and Chone Killers, both strong gangs based in the northern province of Esmeraldas and the southern province of Guayas, respectively.","The Lobos operated mainly in the cities of Latacunga and Cuenca, in the Amazonian province of Pastaza, and in the coastal town of Machala, according to the local press. However, since they began rising to prominence nationwide, the Lobos have established a strong presence in the country's maximum-security prisons. The Lobos are reportedly in complete control of the Turi prison in Cuenca, which houses nearly 1,600 prisoners. They also have a dominant influence in the Sierra Centro and Cotopaxi prisons outside Latacunga. In Guayaquil's Litoral prison, the largest in the country, they control wings 8 and 9, according to pamphlets published by the group in November 2022. According to Metro Ecuador, the Lobos maintain a strong presence in smaller prisons in Cotopaxi, Tungurahua, Chimborazo, Azuay, and El Oro.","The Lobos' primary source of income comes from moving cocaine purchased by Mexican cartels from Colombian groups through Ecuador.Ecuador has emerged as a conveyer belt for Colombian cocaine headed to the US and Europe, with nearly a third of Colombia's cocaine leaving South America through Ecuadorian ports. The Lobos and other Ecuadorian gangs have aided Ecuador's augmented role in the cocaine trade.The Lobos' criminal activities include securing drug shipments in port cities, serving as debt collectors, and working as hired guns or killers for international partners or allied groups. In recent months, Ecuadorian authorities have discovered cocaine processing laboratories in Ecuador, indicating a possible evolution of mega-gangs like the Lobos into what authorities have dubbed ""micro-cartels.""The Lobos also participate in micro-trafficking throughout Ecuador's cities, mainly Quito, Guayaquil, and Quevedo. In March 2021, twelve Lobos members were apprehended and charged with various crimes, including micro-trafficking, extortion, robbery, and possessing illicit firearms. In February 2022, Ecuadorian authorities arrested ten alleged members of Lobos for kidnapping and murder charges in one of the more significant operations against the criminal group.The Lobos and other mega-gangs have achieved dominance and penetration of the prison system through massive corruption of prison officials and bribery schemes reaching as high as prison directors. Lack of infrastructure and funding in many prisons throughout Ecuador has given gangs control over the facilities, often controlling movement and security within pavilions.The violence throughout gang-controlled prisons of Ecuador reflects the group's struggle to control drug trafficking routes outside the prison walls. Prison riots are often proxy wars between groups, with the Lobos using violence as retaliation for confrontations on the outside.","The Lobos are allied with several smaller criminal groups in Ecuador, including the Chone Killers and the Tiguerones. The groups have identified themselves as the Nueva Generación. Some analysts believe that the name pays homage to the Mexican criminal group, the CJNG, allegedly the Ecuadorian syndicate's principal international connection.  The Lobos have connections to other international actors and are linked to Balkan criminal groups, especially Albanians. Nueva Generación reportedly sources the cocaine they traffic through Ecuador's port cities from the 48th Front, a dissident faction of the now-demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC).Domestically, the leading rival group of the Lobos are the Choneros, Ecuador's largest gang. While the Lobos used to be allies of the latter group, they splintered off in early 2021. They also maintain a rival with a smaller gang, the R7, which has led to dozens of deaths in 2022. ","Ecuador has the third-highest level of cocaine seizures in the world after Colombia and the United States, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime's World Drug Report 2022. This means more cocaine, more money, and more weapons flowing through the hands of Ecuador's gangs, including the Lobos. Over the last three years, the Lobos have played a key role in the breakdown of security in Ecuador, leading the country to have the highest homicide rate increase in Latin America in 2021. The Lobos and their allies have helped bring criminal tactics to Ecuador that the country had rarely seen, including gruesome prison massacres, a normalization in contract killings, the use of car bombs, mass targeting of police, and bodies left hanging from bridges as warnings. There is little indication this will change soon. Ecuador's government has not brought any fresh ideas to the table, and the Lobos have only grown in strength."
400 Mawozo,https://insightcrime.org/caribbean-organized-crime-news/400-mawozo/,400 Mawozo,,./images/organizations/400-mawozo.jpg,2022-03-23,"['caribbean', 'haiti', 'haiti groups']",haiti,"The 400 Mawozo (400 Lame Men) gang is currently the largest active criminal group in Haiti. Led by Joseph Wilson, alias “Lanmò San Jou”, the gang has managed to consolidate its power in Croix-des-Bouquets, a hugely important neighborhood and criminal hotspot north of Port-au-Prince, as well as other parts of Haiti.It rose to fame by kidnapping 17 Western missionaries in 2021, but it has carried out thousands of other kidnappings among the Haitian population.","Even though little was known about the 400 Mawozo gang before 2019, when gang clashes involving this group started being reported in Haiti,  this criminal group was created in 2016 and has been expanding significantly since 2018, a security analyst told InSight Crime.Gang experts consistently cite the 400 Mawozo as the country’s most worrying criminal organization. While the gang has many components common to criminal groups in Haiti such as high-powered weaponry, participation criminal economies, and political connections, it stands out for being very innovative.The 400 Mawozo began using “express kidnapping” on a major level in the country. Since about 2020, the gang has sent small groups of men on motorcycles, targeting people located on main roads or on public transportation. The victims are released after a few days after a small ransom is paid as this kidnapping model is based on scale and not high ransoms.","Joseph Wilson, alias “Lanmò San Jou,” is the leader of the 400 Mawozo gang. Lanmò San Jou, which translates to “death has no appointed time,” is wanted by the national authorities to answer charges of murder, attempted murder, kidnapping and vehicle theft.The second-in-command is Germine Joly, alias “Yonyon.” He was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2018, after he was accused of kidnapping, forcible confinement for ransom, rape, armed robbery, murder, illegal possession of a firearm and criminal association to the detriment of a twenty people. Another important lieutenant, alias “Gaspiyaj,” was killed in November 2021 in a shootout with authorities.“With over 1000 members scattered around the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, the 400 Mawozo is said to even have a waiting list of potential youngsters who want to enroll,” said Eric Calpas, a gang researcher on the island who has worked with InSight Crime.","The 400 Mawozo gang is largely focused on collective kidnapping. They were responsible for the abduction of 17 American and Canadian citizens, including five children in October, 2021. Even though at first the victims appeared to have escaped their captors, new information suggests that they were released after a mystery donor contributed to the ransom of $1 million per person.Haiti police inspector Frantz Champagne also blamed the 400 Mawozo for the kidnapping of seven clergy members, including two French citizens in April last year. The gang asked for a $1 million ransom for their liberation. They were all released a week later, but it is unknown whether the ransom demand was met.But religious groups are not the only victims. According to Haiti’s Human Rights Analysis and Research Center (Centre d'Analyse et de Recherche en Droits de l'Homme - CARDH), in the past, 400 Mawozo has also specialized in the extortion of businesses, hijacking of trucks and other kinds of illegal trafficking along the border with the Dominican Republic.","The 400 Mawozo criminal activities have largely been concentrated in the municipality of Croix-des-Bouquets, located in the outskirts of the metropolitan area of Port-au-Prince. However, their presence has also been reported in the municipalities of Ganthier, Thomassseau and Fonds-Verettes.The 400 Mawozo recently established a permanent presence in Canaan, a suburb located in Croix-des-Bouquets that connects to the only route leading to the north of the island.  Calpas explained that this group intends to expand to other parts of the metropolitan area of Port au Prince by surrounding the capital.  According to a security analyst consulted by InSight Crime, the 400 Mawozo has established presence in the border point of Malpasse, across from the Dominican Republic, as well. This source also explained that control over these territories gives 400 Mawozo the opportunity to influence the elections of four national deputies, control 64 voting stations and the Croix-des-Bouquets prison, where many of its members are behind bars.In addition, their presence in the border with the Dominican Republic gives them access to criminal activities that take place in this area, such as contraband, human smuggling, human trafficking, arms trafficking and drug trafficking.","InSight Crime has not identified alliances or rivalries involving 400 Mawozo. However, according to the CARDH, they have sent ammunition to the Village de Dieu gang in Port-au-Prince. In addition, it is likely that small armed groups in the suburb of Canaan have attached themselves to the structure of 400 Mawozo, contributing to the expansion of the group.","The involvement of the 400 Mawozo in lucrative criminal economies gives this group the financial muscle to recruit more members and arm them. Their large and strategic geographic presence not only provides the gang with access to potential kidnapping victims, but also businesses to extort.The expansion of the 400 Mawozo indicates that it likely has secured the political influence needed to maintain its control, as other gangs such as the G9 have done. The gang controls the only route connecting Port-au-Prince to the north of Haiti, meaning it can choose whether to allow the passage of goods and people. Yet there has been no major crackdown on the group so far. One former Haitian government official told InSight Crime on condition of anonymity that “there are 400 Mawozo wearing suits and ties.”"
10th Front - Ex-FARC Mafia,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/10th-front-ex-farc-mafia/,10th Front - Ex-FARC Mafia,,./images/organizations/10th-front---ex-farc-mafia.jpg,2022-01-18,"['colombia groups', 'ex-farc mafia', 'gentil duarte']",colombia,"The 10th Front, also known as the Martín Villa Front, is one of the most active elements of the ex-FARC Mafia, a loosely connected network of criminal groups that splintered off from the defunct Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC).Shortly after the 2016 demobilization agreement between the FARC and the Colombian government, dissident elements of the 10th Front emerged in Colombia's Arauca department. Since then, it has expanded into Venezuela, most notably in the state of Apure, where it has engaged in repeated hostilities with other ex-FARC Mafia groups, the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN) and the Venezuelan authorities. ","Prior to the demobilization of the FARC, the 10th Front was part of the group's Eastern Bloc (Bloque Oriental) and was once commanded by Germán Briceño Suárez, alias ""Grannobles,"" the brother of Víctor Julio Suárez Rojas, alias ""Mono Jojoy,"" one of the FARC's most senior figures until his death in 2010. They were in the frontlines of the FARC's war with the ELN in Arauca between 2004 and 2010, which killed and displaced hundreds. After the FARC signed the peace agreement in 2016, numerous members refused to lay down their arms. Dissident members of the 10th, 28th, 38th, 45th and 56th Fronts abandoned the reintegration process and formed the new Martín Villa 10th Front dissidence in the Colombian department of Arauca and the Venezuelan state of Apure. The group soon received support from the 1st Front dissidents, led by Miguel Botache Santillana, alias ""Gentil Duarte,"" and Néstor Gregorio Vera Fernández, alias ""Iván Mordisco.""In September 2020, the 10th Front began to face off against two separate adversaries, as InSight Crime reported in an investigation at the time. First, it became a spearhead for Gentil Duarte against his largest rivals in the ex-FARC Mafia, the Second Marquetalia. Led by some of the most prominent former FARC commanders, the Second Marquetalia also sought to claim the legacy of the old guerrilla group and operated in both Colombia and Venezuela. Repeated clashes by the 10th Front saw the Second Marquetalia pushed back and three of its four top leaders killed on Venezuelan soil.","The Martín Villa 10th Front has a wide-ranging criminal portfolio on both sides of the Colombia-Venezuela border.The group is involved in transporting and sending drug shipments across the border from Apure state. According to field investigations conducted by InSight Crime, the group controls several clandestine airstrips from where drug shipments leave for Central America and the Caribbean.In addition to participating in drug trafficking, the 10th Front also profits from extorting business owners and ranchers on both sides of the border. The group has also been involved in several kidnappings in the Arauca department. According to reports of these incidents, the people kidnapped on the Colombian side of the border are taken to Venezuela. However, it is unclear whether the group receives any gains in the form of ransom payments.","Jorge Eliecer Jiménez Martínez, alias ‘Arturo’ or alias ‘Gerónimo,’ was considered the leader of the 10th Front when he was killed in a Colombian military strike in February 2022. The attack occurred when the group crossed from Venezuela into Arauca and was a severe blow, leaving nearly two dozen dead. Jiménez Martínez, who was previously a member of the 56th Front, was arrested in 2004 and received amnesty in 2017 as part of the peace process. Shortly thereafter, he deserted the peace process and joined the 10th Front dissidents.Among the other important leaders of the group are Fabián Eliécer Jiménez Martínez, alias ""Ferley González,"" who acts as the dissidence’s financial head, and Luis Felipe Ramírez, alias “Pescado,” who serves as the group’s explosives expert and third-in-command","Since its inception, the 10th Front dissidents have been linked to Gentil Duarte and Iván Mordisco. More recently, the group has been linked to the 28th Front in Casanare, a group which has come to the group's defense on several occasions.The 10th Front expanded into Venezuela, originally finding approval by Venezuelan authorities, which allowed the group to settle in the state of Apure. However, the criminal loyalties of the Venezuelan regime shifted with the rise of the Second Marquetalia. After rejecting initial outreach efforts by the leader of the Second Marquetalia, Iván Márquez, in March 2021, a war broke out between the 10th Front and security forces in Venezuela. According to investigations conducted by InSight Crime, the conflict was motivated, in part, by the relationship between the Segunda Marquetalia and the Venezuelan government.Despite the fact that the 10th Front managed to force security forces to withdraw in Apure, security forces in Venezuela continued to crack down on the group, arresting hundreds of people accused of having links with the group in an attempt to undermine their support networks.Until late 2021, the 10th Front dissidence and the ELN, also present in Arauca and Apure, did not have a hostile relationship. According to several sources and press reports, both groups maintain territorial division agreements and criminal economies on both sides of the border. However, on January 2, 2022, several alleged members of the 10th Front were murdered by the ELN in Apure, Venezuela and Arauca, Colombia. This conflict has only intensified throughout January, with dozens killed and hundreds displaced.","According to press reports and alerts issued by the Ombudsman's Office in Colombia, and field work conducted by InSight Crime, the Martín Villa 10th Front is present in the municipalities of Arauca, Arauquita, Tame, Saravena and Cravo Norte, in the Arauca department, and in the municipalities of Páez, Rómulo Gallegos and Pedro Camejo in the Venezuelan state of Apure.","The 10th Front is making a habit of claiming victory against unenviable odds. Despite its victory against the Venezuelan army in 2021, the 10th Front found itself at a disadvantage when compared to the rival Second Marquetalia, which had the support of the security forces and local authorities in Apure.However, the murders of Second Marquetalia commanders, Hernán Darío Velásquez Saldarriaga, alias El Paisa, and Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias Romaña, in December 2021, gave the 10th Front a distinct advantage.Recent clashes with the ELN may be a step too far for the 10th Front, as they confront the strongest criminal group on both sides of the border. It has not yet been confirmed which side began the conflict in January 2022. But either way, the 10th Front faces an uphill battle to come out on top. "
Pachenca,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/pachenca/,Pachenca,,./images/organizations/pachenca.jpg,2022-05-10,"['colombia', 'colombia groups']",colombia,"The Pachenca, also known as the Conquering Self-Defense Forces of the Sierra (Autodefensas Conquistadores de la Sierra), emerged following the demobilization of paramilitary blocs along Colombia’s Caribbean Coast.Led by Hernán Giraldo, a former paramilitary commander in the region, the Pachenca have managed to consolidate their power in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, as well as other parts of Colombia, where they have a range of criminal economies.","Los Pachenca emerged from the Tayrona Resistance Bloc (Bloque Resistencia Tayrona - BRT) of the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC), commanded by Hernán Giraldo Serna, alias “El Patrón.”In 2004, Giraldo Serna decided to create the Caribbean Office, a criminal structure with a model similar to that of the Oficina de Envigado, dedicated to regulating drug trafficking operations.The BRT demobilized in February 2006, and in 2008, Giraldo was extradited to the United States. However, he left behind an extensive network of sons, brothers and nephews to run the Caribbean Office’s criminal emporium.However, in 2012, skirmishes broke out between the Urabeños and the heirs of the Giraldo Clan, leading to more than 150 deaths in just a few months.In 2013, Jesús María Aguirre Gallego, alias “Chucho Mercancía” or “Chucho Pachenca,” one of the former lieutenants of the Urabeños in Magdalena, assumed leadership of the Giraldo Clan. It was at that point that the group assumed the name: the Pachenca.Under “Chucho Mercancía,” the Urabeños and the Pachenca became allies, working together to move drugs from the northern part of the country.Despite a calm that lasted for several years, differences began to emerge within the Pachenca, which, in addition to blows by public security forces, hit the group hard. The first was the May 2019 arrest of alias “Flash,” the second in command. In June of that year, the group’s leader, Chucho Mercancía, was killed by public security forces in the vicinity of the Sierra Nevada, apparently betrayed by someone within his inner circle.  Then Deimer Patiño Giraldo, alias “80,” Hernán Giraldo’s nephew, assumed leadership of the group. New leadership led to a new name: the Conquering Self Defense Forces of the Sierra, and distance from the Urabeños, who started to dispute key drug trafficking areas in the Caribbean, such as the port of Santa Marta.Patiño Giraldo was killed in June 2020 during a police operation that left the group without clear leadership.In January 2021, Hernán Giraldo Serna, the former leader of the Pachenca, returned to Colombia after having served a 12-year prison sentence on drug trafficking charges in the United States.With its top leader back in the country, the group seems to have regained some strength. However, the group continues to be the subject of repeated operations by both the Colombian government and the Urabeños.","The Pachenca participate in various criminal economies, some of which were inherited from the Tayrona Resistance Bloc.They participate in the collection, transport and shipment of drugs through Caribbean ports, for which they use smaller local networks. Extortion is another of its main sources of income, which has increased as tourism has boomed along the beaches surrounding the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. The Pachenca collect regular payments from merchants and residents in these areas, where tourism generates permanent income for sector workers.Land sales have also proven to be a source of income. The group has pressured landowners in the region to sell their properties and thus obtain a percentage of the sale. Should a land owner refuse, the group dispossesses the property, forcibly displacing the owner, and then directly sells the parcel of land.The group has also been linked to the murder of social and community leaders in the Sierra Nevada. One of the most well-known cases is that of the homicide of the environmental leader Alejandro Llinás, who, in the days before his death in 2020, denounced some illegal tolls that the Pachenca set up to regulate tourists' access to areas surrounding the Tayrona National Park.","Hernán Giraldo and his extensive family network have led the Pachenca since the group began. On the operational level, known leaders have included“Chucho Mercancía,” alias “Flash” and alias “80.”It is known that internal differences within the group have made it difficult to consolidate strong leadership, although there are some names that the authorities have considered as new leaders.The Pachenca have continued on the path set by alias ""80,"" looking to be identified more as a political actor than as a criminal actor, therefore they deny any direct link to illegal economies.In October 2020, the group published a video in which it presented its military structure, made up by the Renacer Guajira, Cóndor de la Sierra, Bananeros, Urbano Cacique and Metro Barranquilla fronts. It is believed that the group could have between 150 and 200 armed men.","The Urabeños have been both one of the Pachenca’s main allies and bitterest enemies at different times. While they clashed in the beginning, the Pachenca later served as one of the Urabeños’ main operators for several years - handling drugs shipments in northern Colombia. In 2021 and 2022, the two groups were fighting a brutal war for control of drug trafficking in the northern departments of Magdalena and Cesar. In Magdalena, fights were reported in the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta mountain range for control of the town of Ciénaga, which sits on a strategic corridor for drug trafficking to Colombia's Caribbean ports. The violence has displaced over 1,000 people. These clashes have spilled over into the municipalities of Copey and Puerto Bello in Cesar, with assassinations, gun battles and patrols by armed groups increasing in 2022. The Pachenca have also formed alliances with smaller, but key, drug trafficking networks. Among these, was the network led by Elkin Javier López, alias “La Silla.” Through this alliance, the Pachenca came to have an impact on the drug trafficking landscape at the port of Santa Marta. After “La Silla” started to collaborate with the Urabeños, the Pachenca had to look for another ally in the region.Likewise, the Pachenca have formed ties with small gangs of hitmen, particularly in the urban areas where they have a presence.","Los Pachenca have a presence in different municipalities in Cesar, Guajira and Magdalena, however, their main enclave is in the Sierra Nevada of Santa Marta. This is a strategic territory as it connects drug-producing enclaves, like Catatumbo, in the Norte de Santander department, to sea routes via different rivers and natural ports in the territory.Although different groups have sought to banish the Pachenca from the area, their control in the Sierra is associated with the figure of Hernán Giraldo, who continues to exercise significant symbolic power in these territories.","Despite blows to the Pachenca in recent years, after the dispute with the Urabeños and operations by public security forces, the group is not yet in its final days.  While the group has lost key territories under its control, such as the city of Santa Marta and its port, it continues to dominate the Sierra Nevada, a key territory for any group that wants to consolidate criminal economies in the Caribbean.The Pachenca’s secret lies in its historical presence in the Sierra Nevada and the influence that Hernán Giraldo has in these territories. After more than three decades of uninterrupted influence by Giraldo and his men in these territories, social, family and community networks make it nearly impossible for other groups to overtake their presence in the region."
Bala na Cara,https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/bala-na-cara/,Bala na Cara,,./images/organizations/bala-na-cara.jpg,2021-07-27,"['brazil', 'brazil groups']",brazil,"Bala na Cara (Bullet in the Face - BNC) is a prominent criminal group headquartered in Brazil's southernmost state of Rio Grande do Sul, but with a presence in southern Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay and Argentina. The group is known for its frequent use of violence and controlling the city of Porto Alegre's drug trade. In addition to trafficking cocaine and marijuana, the group controls the supply of crack in prisons in the area. ","The BNC was founded in the Bom Jesus neighborhood of Porto Alegre in the 2000s. Its name - which translates as ""Bullet in the Face"" - is reportedly derived from the violent method the group uses to kill its enemies.In its early days, the BNC principally focused on robbing jewelry stores and banks to fund arms trafficking. It also worked as an armed wing that committed contract killings for Rio Grande do Sul's most important criminal organization, Os Manos.From the early 2010s, drug trafficking became the group's main source of revenue as it expanded across Porto Alegre. It used extreme violence to claim drug sales points, committing homicides and massacres to target rivals. These attacks also resulted in the deaths of civilians caught in the crossfire.This sparked a hostile response from local gangs in the municipality. In 2016, criminal groups in Porto Alegre banded together to create the ""Anti-Bala"" coalition in an attempt to take down the BNC. In January 2016, the coalition kidnapped and beheaded a BNC member, leaving his head in Bom Jesus and his body with a message in Porto Alegre's Mário Quintana neighborhood.Alongside its local growth, the BNC has also started to build a presence in South American countries that neighbor Brazil. From around 2015, the group moved into Paraguay, where a number of its leaders have been arrested. There, they are involved in drug trafficking in borderland zones, like the city of Pedro Juan Caballero. The group has also made attempts to move into Uruguay's drug trade. It was gaining territory and control over drug trafficking along the Brazil-Uruguay border until the Os Manos challenged this in 2018. ","In contrast to its main rivals, the BNC does not have a centralized structure with a singular, defined leader.Instead, the group is made up of individual cells falling under local leadership. Police believe that at least four leaders set overarching rules for members of the gang to follow, but that leaders of each local faction give more specific orders. This decentralized structure has hindered police investigations. In 2016, police arrested José Dalvani Nunes Rodrigues, alias ""Minhoca,"" in Paraguay. He was the alleged leader of a BNC faction that moved 500 thousand reais (over $97,000) per week. The local leader was allegedly responsible for drug trafficking in northern Porto Alegre, particularly in the Mário Quintana and Rubem Berta neighborhoods. He also allegedly ordered homicides and coordinated arms sales.Ernesto Andrés Vargas Villanueva, alias ""Cachorrinho,"" is reportedly a leader of the group, overseeing operations for the group in Uruguay. He is a known trafficker of drugs and arms who is currently behind bars for his role in a number of homicides. Tiago Soares da Silva, alias ""Pequeno,"" is considered another leader of the group. He was one of Rio Grande do Sul's most wanted fugitives before his March 2021 arrest for his alleged involvement in a number of homicides.","The BNC's main base is the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre, located in the east of Rio Grande do Sul state. The group also began to expand into the state's interior from around 2018.Outside of Brazil, the BNC is involved in drug trafficking in Paraguay, particularly in the borderland city of Pedro Juan Caballero where a number of its members have been arrested. It is also active in Uruguay, which sits just across the border from Rio Grande do Sul. The group once controlled drug trafficking in Uruguay's northern borderland city of Rivera. However, in 2018, Os Manos began to challenge this. As the battle continues, bloodshed has been seen across Rivera.The BNC also maintains a presence in Argentina's northeastern province of Misiones.","The BNC's main rivals are the ""Anti-Bala,"" or ""V7 gang,"" a coalition of gangs formed in retaliation to the group's violent expansion in Porto Alegre. This rivalry was ignited after the Anti-Bala kidnapped and beheaded a BNC member in 2016.This has led to a bloody turf war involving beheadings and dismembered bodies being left on public display. The conflict has also spilled over into other zones of Rio Grande do Sul.Another rival of the BNC is the Os Manos gang, Rio Grande do Sul's most prominent criminal organization. Os Manos are reportedly not involved in the war waged against the BNC in Porto Alegre. However, as both groups have expanded into the interior of Rio Grande do Sul and neighboring countries, they have clashed. The BNC also counts the Os Tauras gang as one of its rivals in Uruguay.","Authorities have had little success in curbing the BNC's growth, and efforts by enemies to bring down the group have so far had a negligible impact. This suggests the group will continue to control drug trafficking in its current strongholds and may take over the trade in other strategic hubs.The group is likely to maintain a localized focus on Rio Grande do Sul, and borderland zones shared between Brazil and Paraguay, Argentina and Uruguay. If it makes new attempts to expand further afield, bloodshed will inevitably follow, as has been the case following the group's expansion into Uruguay's city of Rivera. ",
Border Command,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/border-command/,Border Command,,./images/organizations/border-command.jpg,2022-06-11,"['colombia', 'colombia groups', 'ex-farc mafia']",colombia,"Los Comandos de la Frontera, or the Border Command, formerly known as La Mafia, is a group made up of dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) and La Constru, a post-demobilization successor of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC), which looks to maintain control over drug trafficking in Bajo Putumayo and along Colombia’s border with Ecuador.","La Mafia formed as an alliance between dissident elements of the now defunct-FARC’s 48th and 32nd Fronts and La Constru to reactivate drug trafficking in Putumayo after the signing of the Peace Agreement affected the prices of base paste and cocaine hydrochloride, making them less profitable.However, the group, now called the Comandos de Frontera, or the Border Command, have become a criminal actor in their own right. The group changed its name at the end of 2020 in an attempt to clean up its image and distance itself from the threats against and murders of social leaders. Nevertheless, it continues to intimidate communities and engage in a conflict with the Carolina Ramírez Front, another dissident group of the FARC, with which it competes for control of illegal crops and drug trafficking routes.","The Border Command is involved in the entire drug trafficking chain in the areas where it has a presence. According to sources on the ground who spoke to InSight Crime, the elements of the dissent were responsible for the protection of crops and crystallizations, while the Constru was in charge of international contacts to negotiate the shipments.The group controls coca-growing areas, intimidating coca farmers to monopolize the purchase of base paste, and also has crystallizers where it is processed. Additionally, they are responsible for the moving cocaine and marijuana shipments down the Putumayo and San Miguel rivers to cross-border points into Ecuador and Brazil.For this reason, and in order to prevent the expansion of its enemies, the group has implemented social control measures, including illegal checkpoints, the murder of social leaders, curfews and widespread threats against the population.","Originally led by Pedro Oberman Goyes, alias “Sinaloa,” who was murdered by members of the group in 2019. Additionally, the leader of La Constru, Miguel Antonio Bastidas Bravo, alias “Gárgola,” was also said to have led the group until his arrest in 2019. The group is now led by Giovanny Andrés Rojas, alias ""Araña.""","The Border Command disputes control of several municipalities in the department of Putumayo with another group of the Ex-FARC Mafia: the Carolina Ramírez Front, which is allied with Gentil Duarte. The clashes between the two groups started after alias Sinaloa refused to join Gentil Duarte’s group in 2019.In March 2021, the group announced an alliance with the Second Marquetalia, a leader ex-FARC Mafia faction led by Iván Márquez, changing its name one again to include the words ""Ejército Boliviano"" or “Bolivarian Army.” However, this alliance may not last for much longer after much of the leadership of the Second Marquetalia was killed between 2021 and 2022. ","The group maintains its largest area of operation in the municipalities of Bajo Putumayo (Orito, San Miguel, Valle del Guamuéz and Puerto Guzmán), on the border with Ecuador, a country with which it also has a presence. In the Ecuadorian province of Sucumbíos, authorities have found encampments and allegorical propaganda.Additionally, the Border Command is seeking over to take coca-growing territories to the north of Putumayo. In May 2022, Colombia's Ombudsman confirmed the Border Command had moved into the municipalities of Cartagena del Chairá, El Paujíl, La Montañita and Solano in the department of Caquetá. In rural parts of these municipalities, residents have registered homicides, kidnappings, forced recruitment of children and teenagers. According to the Ombudsman report, the Border Command is fighting the dissident ex-FARC Carolina Ramírez Front to control the production and sale of coca paste in southern Colombia. ","While the alliance with the Second Marquetalia provides the Border Command with more allies, any tangible consequences of such an agreement are yet to be seen.For the moment, the group is trying to consolidate its presence to the north of the Putumayo department, near the border with Cauca and Caquetá, territory that is disputed with the Carolina Ramirez Front, while maintaining an tight grip on the south of the department and the drug trafficking routes that pass through it.It is currently one of the most important criminal groups operating along the border between Colombia and Ecuador and controls much of the drug trafficking and contraband smuggling between the two countries."
G9 and Family,https://insightcrime.org/caribbean-organized-crime-news/g9-family-profile/,G9 and Family,,./images/organizations/g9-and-family.jpg,2022-07-18,"['caribbean', 'haiti', 'haiti groups']",haiti,"The “G9 and Family” (G9 an fanmi – G9) is a criminal federation of nine of the strongest gangs in Haiti’s capital of Port-au-Prince. Founded in June 2020 by former police officer turned gang leader Jimmy Chérizier, alias ""Barbecue,"" the coalition allowed member gangs to expand their territory and offer politicians a unified weapon with which to suppress their opposition. The group is also referred to by the longer name G9 Fanmi e Alye (G9 Family and Allies). Formerly linked to since-assassinated Haitian President Jovenel Moïse and his ruling Haitian Tèt Kale Party (Parti Haïtien Tèt Kale – PHTK), for whom the G9 is alleged to have ensured votes and quelled social unrest in gang-controlled neighborhoods, the coalition now threatens to challenge the Haitian state itself, with Chérizier calling for a “revolution” in June 2021.","Jimmy Chérizier’s criminal career dates back to at least 2017. That year, in November, Chérizier the police officer took part in a supposed anti-gang operation in the Grand Ravine neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, which ended in the extrajudicial execution of at least 14 innocent civilians.A year later, in November 2018, Chérizier was allegedly involved in murdering up to 71 more people in what became known as the La Saline Massacre, the worst to rock Haiti in more than a decade.He was promptly fired and a warrant issued for his arrest. Yet Chérizier would evade capture, even participating in another massacre in Bel-Air in 2019 and a coordinated multi-gang attack in May 2020 in the Cité Soleil commune, a politically strategic area.He was allegedly able to do all this because of the material, logistical and financial support provided to gangs by the government of President Moïse, which enabled and encouraged these state-sponsored massacres through transfers of money, weapons, police uniforms, and government vehicles, according to one report.At the time, President Moïse was facing constant protests demanding his resignation by Haitians who blamed him for the country's dire economic crisis, rampant corruption, gasoline shortages, and rising violence.Hence, when Chérizier resurfaced in a June 2020 Youtube video to announce the formation of the G9 alliance, the new coalition was immediately suspected of representing a formalized continuation of the status quo: namely, political figures wielding gangs to repress their opponents and maintain social order in poor neighborhoods.Taking place within a context of gang proliferation and escalating political violence, Chérizier presented the coalition as a necessary measure to restoring peace in the large neighborhoods.In that, it failed utterly. According to Vice News, Haiti saw a 400 percent increase in kidnappings between 2019 and 2020, which, despite being allegedly facilitated by gang members using police uniforms and police vehicles, led President Moïse to request support and solidarity from the Haitian people.Further bouts of violence resulted from internal clashes within the increasingly tense G9 federation, with Chérizier having to play peacemaker after the Grand Ravine gang launched attacks on the rival gang-controlled neighborhood of Martissant in mid-2021.Most recently, in July 2021, the G9’s alleged political sponsor, President Moïse, was assassinated in his private residence by unidentified armed men. The G9 had already somewhat distanced itself from Moïse, with Chérizier filming a video in June in which he called for a revolution against the opposition, business sector and Moïse’s party, yet it remains unclear what this will mean for the federation.","At present, the G9 remains a local or at most regional criminal actor, with no links to transnational criminal activities like drug trafficking. This is not only because member gangs are focused on national politics, but also because each group remains financially independent from the coalition, limiting larger-scale criminal investments.As such, their main revenue stream is extortion. This takes several forms, from outright predation to criminal governance. On the one side is the charging of “protection payments” on local businesses, street vendor stands, and public transportation drivers, as well as the kidnapping for ransom of wealthy and poor alike. On the other is the takeover of public services such as electricity or water provision in exchange for payment.Regional arms trafficking, or more specifically arms distribution, may also be one of the G9’s emerging criminal activities, though there is not enough evidence to say for sure. The federation is thought to use its government contacts to remain consistently supplied with small arms and ammunition, keeping it better equipped than the police, but it is also theorized that it sells spare weapons on to small gangs within its broader “G20” criminal network (see “Allies and Enemies”).","As an urban phenomenon, the G9 is heavily concentrated in Haiti’s capital: Port-au-Prince. Different member gangs control different neighborhoods, with members granted varying access to each other’s territory. For example, one gang’s kidnapping operations may receive logistical support from other gangs in the federation, including the use of popular abduction sites such as Grand Ravine and Village de Dieu.While the true extent of their reach is unknown, the Fondasyon Je Klere (FJKL) has reported that the G9 is known to occupy the Belecourt sector of the Cité Soleil district of Port-au-Prince, the Chancerelles, Delmas, La Saline, Martissant and Pont Rouge neighborhoods, the Fontamara suburb of Port-au-Prince, the Waf Jérémie slum, as well as Rue Saint-Martin and Rue Porcelaine.Rezo Nòdwès, a local Haitian media outlet, has also reported that the G9 maintains control of Belekou in the Cité Soleil district of Port-au-Prince, the Grand-Ravine commune, and the Village de Dieu. According to Rezo Nòdwès, the G9 has made the Waf Jérémie neighborhood in the center of Port-au-Prince its operational headquarters after taking control of the neighborhood in the aftermath of the Pont Rouge Massacre in May of 2020.In a June 2020 report by the FJKL, it is suspected that the G9 is attempting to organize all criminal organizations in the working-class neighborhoods of Western Haiti, before spreading to other parts of the country and expanding their criminal coalition.","With over 150 active gangs in Haiti, the G9 are bound to have critical allies and dangerous enemies.Most crucially, are the eight leaders and gangs of the G9 itself, besides Chérizier and his Delmas gang: James Alexander, alias ""Sonson,” of the Baz Krache Dife gang; Ezeckiel Alexandre of the Baz Pilate gang; Christ Roy Chery, alias “Krisla,” of the Nan Ti Bwa gang; Albert Stevenson, alias “Djouma,” of the Simon Pelé's gang (now arrested); Serge Alectis, alias “Ti Junior,” of the Baz Nan Chabon gang; Jean Emiliano Micanor, alias ""Micano,"" of the Waf Jérémie gang; Cendy Marcellin, alias ""Zoé,"" of the Nan Boston gang; Andris Icard, alias “Iska,” of the Belekou gang.After that, the National Human Rights Defense Network (RNDDH) has reported that eleven other criminal organizations in Port-au-Prince maintain friendly relations with the G9 and even provide support when necessary. The relationship between the G9 and these eleven other organizations is oftentimes referred to as the “G20”.Going wider still, there are the alleged political connections to police officers and government officials within the Moïse administration, who were suspected of granting members of the G9 immunity from law enforcement authorities - since so few have ever been arrested. Even after Moïse’s assassination, many of these individual ties are likely to remain in place.Finally on the regional or national level, the Fondasyon Je Klere (FJKL) has reported that the G9 has aspirations to work with criminal organizations outside of Port-au-Prince in order to spread their “movement” across the country. Among the potential candidates for this unholy partnership, are the 400 Mawozo Gang of the Ganthier commune in central Haiti and the Savien Gang of the northern Artibonite Department of Haiti.As for enemies, the G9 is confronted by several pro-opposition gangs, such as the Cité Soleil-based Fanmi Lavalas, which Chérizier attacked in a multi-gang assault in May 2020 prior to the formation of the G9.In some instances, the G9 can even be its own enemy. Made up of criminal organizations from Port-au-Prince, it is no surprise that some of the organizations that are now working together were once formidable enemies. Despite the overarching message of the G9 “movement” and its desire to acquire more power, the long-held rivalries between the criminal organization of the G9 occasionally resurface and lead to infighting.In June of 2021, the Grand Ravine gang and Ti Bwa gangs of the G9 fought viciously against each other over a territory dispute. The Ti Bwa gang had taken control of districts 1, 2, 3 and 7 in Martissant from the Grand Ravine gang, now an ally in the G9 organization. The Grand Ravine, despite its newfound friendship with the Ti Bwa, fought its own ally in an effort to recoup what was once their territory. This forced Chérizier to act as a negotiator between the two criminal organizations in order to salvage the G9 and ensure its survival.","As of July 2021, the G9’s future is uncertain.On the one hand, the coalition has likely lost an important protector and may no longer be a palatable or even, given its volatility and infighting, useful partner for any future PHTK leader. In particular, should the G9 splinter further, its individual gangs and members would be unlikely to enjoy the same level of political protection given their reduced ability to serve government interests.On the other hand, the longstanding impunity the G9’s founder and member gangs have enjoyed has made them powerful criminal actors, equipped with serious weaponry and the militarized organizational structure within which best to use them. It is even conceivable that the death of President Moïse will benefit the G9 by exacerbating Haiti’s pre-existing governance vacuum, allowing certain groups or leaders – such as Jimmy Chérizier -- to further penetrate the capital’s economic, social and political domains.",
Lagartos,https://insightcrime.org/ecuador-organized-crime-news/los-lagartos/,Lagartos,,./images/organizations/lagartos.jpg,2021-06-01,"['ecuador', 'ecuador groups', 'prisons']",ecuador,"Made up of multiple smaller gangs with common allies and enemies, the Lagartos are one of Ecuador’s prolific prison gangs, whose rivalry with the Choneros has spurned unprecedented levels of violence in Ecuador’s streets and penitentiary system.The rivalry between the Lagartos and the Choneros is at the core of Ecuador’s recent rise in criminal violence and yet, the genesis of the rivalry derives from the history of two gangs within the Lagartos’ ranks: the Cubanos and the Gorras.The Cubanos and the Gorras both originated in Guasmo Sur, Guayaquil, Ecuador, where the gangs’ leaders – William Poveda Salazar, alias ""El Cubano,"" and Giovanny Mantilla Ceballos, alias ""Gorras"" – rose to prominence through microtrafficking and contract killings. While the Cubanos and the Gorras collaborated on occasion, their alliance under the Lagartos name only came about in 2019, when they joined forces to combat a common enemy: the Choneros. Ecuador’s most prominent gang, the Choneros have waged an interminable war against rivals in Ecuador’s penitentiary system for control of criminal economies.Following the death of consecutive leaders, the Lagartos have been weakened, no longer posing the same threat that once drew the attention and ire of the Choneros. But with the Choneros now under attack by a number of other rivals, the Lagartos may be regrouping.","The name ""Lagartos” derives from a gang that has operated in Ecuador’s penitentiary system for at least ten years, serving primarily as hired guns to carry out assassinations for larger groups. As such, the Lagartos remained under the radar, maintaining neutrality, while the Choneros and the Cubanos battled for control of criminal economies in Ecuador’s penitentiary system.One man would become crucial to the rise of the Lagartos. Giovanny Mantilla Ceballos, alias ""Gorras,"" controlled micro-trafficking in Guayaquil, where he similarly originated in Guasmo Sur and had a criminal background as a member of the gang, the Latin Kings, a gang originated in the US by Puerto Rican and Mexican immigrants, and established in Ecuador in the 1990s.While serving his prison sentence, El Cubano began recruiting inmates to join his ranks to challenge the outsized power of the Choneros, who had been clashing with the Cubanos in the penitentiary system since 2009.For the next decade, the Cubanos and the Choneros battled for control of criminal economies in Ecuador’s prisons, with casualties on both sides perpetuating the rivalry, including the deaths of El Cubano’s brothers, Kléber, alias Metralla, and Walter, alias Caimán.In 2018, Gorras was arrested and imprisoned on charges of organized delinquency. Because of the longstanding rivalry that he had had with the Choneros, Gorras aligned himself with the Lagartos gang for protection, according to prison guards who spoke with El Universo.This proved to be the right move. In response to the spiraling violence provoked by the Cubanos and the Choneros in Ecuador’s penitentiary systems, President Lenín Moreno declared a prison crisis in May 2019 and deployed the military to mitigate gang wars. One facet of Moreno’s strategy was to transfer violent gang members and leaders to prisons across the country. However, this had the unwanted consequence of multiplying prison violence by leading to the creation of derivate gangs, which have been waging proxy wars across the country.Days after the declaration of Ecuador’s prison crisis, the Choneros attacked members of the Gorras in the Litoral Penitentiary, leaving six inmates dead, including Ricardo Mantilla, the brother of Gorras. Less than two weeks later, the Choneros struck again, assassinating El Cubano in gruesome fashion and, ostensibly, dealing a death knell to its chief rival.In the wake of El Cubano’s death, Gorras assumed command, and merged the Gorras, the Cubanos and the Lagartos under the latter’s name to challenge the dominance of the Choneros.Under Gorras’ leadership, the stronger iteration of the Lagartos was born and waged a vicious war against the Choneros in Ecuador’s streets and penitentiary system, sparking epidemic levels of violence, as the two gangs competed for control of street-level drug sales.However, the unexpected death of Gorras to COVID-19 in June 2020, splintered the Lagartos, leaving the distinct gangs comprising the group without a central leader to coordinate action.Taking advantage of the Lagartos’ weakness, the Choneros attacked the gang in August 2020, attempting to take control of the prison sector pertaining to the group in the Litoral Penitentiary – a siege on their home turf. As a result, on September 5, 2020, a fraction of Lagartos laid down their weapons and negotiated a truce with the Choneros, abandoning their post in the prison under the conditions that they would be transferred to a secure prison block, isolating them from further attacks.","As an amalgamation of distinct gangs, the Lagartos have historically relied on the uniting force of a central leader. Prior to the united iteration of the Lagartos, the gang functioned as an allied group of inmates without a centralized leader. Rather, the group operated as a collective of hired guns, with members carrying out hits for stronger gangs, such as the Choneros and the Cubanos, while maintaining neutrality.Following the death of El Cubano in June 2019, Gorras assumed leadership of the coalition integrated by the Cubanos, the Gorras and the Lagartos, uniting the three gangs to fend off the Choneros, who were waging a war to eliminate rivals in the penitentiary system.The Lagartos reached its apex of power under the leadership of Gorras, challenging the Choneros for control of contraband and micro-trafficking in Ecuador’s prisons, as well as in the streets, where their rivalry seeded violence in local communities and drove levels of violence to unprecedented levels in Ecuador.However, with the death of Gorras to COVID-19 in June 2020, the Lagartos began to fragment, as the distinct gangs comprising the group no longer had a central leader to unite their criminal structures. According to Ecuadorian authorities, Carlos Mantilla, alias ""Choclo,"" assumed leadership of the Lagartos in the wake of his brother’s death.","The Lagartos’ criminal economies are concentrated in Guayaquil where both the Cubanos and the Gorras once controlled microtrafficking. The unification of these two gangs under the “Lagartos” name solidified the gang’s dominance of criminal economies in the area and permitted the gang to stave off incursions by the Choneros. Moreover, the Litoral Penitentiary in Guayaquil contains the majority of the Lagartos’ members, including its current leader, Choclo.The gang also maintains a presence in penitentiaries across the country, such as el Centro de Privación de Libertad (CPL) Azuay N.º 1, El Turi in Cuenca; el Centro de Rehabilitación Social (CRS) Masculino Guayas N.º 4, in Guayaquil; and the Penitenciaria el Litoral and El Centro de Rehabilitación Social Regional Sierra Centro Norte Cotopaxi, en Latacunga.","The Lagartos provide assassination and security services to local and international traffickers in exchange for cash, products to sell, or the opportunity to invest in international shipments. ""Gorras"" was widely known for leading the provision of these services in Guayaquil, its main area of operations, but now that he is dead, the Choneros could take the opportunity to strengthen their presence in the city.","The Lagartos' primary rival is the Choneros. In recent years, the rivalry between the two groups has come to define Ecuador’s contemporary fault-line of violence, with each gang’s proxy groups fighting for control of criminal economies in prisons across the country.The proxy gangs aligned with the Lagartos are the Gángster Negros in Esmeraldas, the Latin Kings in Durán, and the Cuartel de las Feas in Guacamo, while the Tiguerones, the Lobos, and Chone Killers were once loyal to the Choneros.It is worth noting that an internal dispute inside the Choneros for leadership of the group began February 2021 in a riot across several prisons that left at least 78 prisoners dead. While the Lagartos and its allies were not directly involved in this event, the bloodshed that has continued ever since may result in shifting alliances within Ecuador's loosely defined prison gangs. ","The Lagartos' truce with the Choneros, brokered in September 2020 in exchange for total security within the Litoral Penitentiary, showed how the Lagartos were significantly weakened by the death of their leader, Gorras, in June 2020. Despite the leadership of Gorras’ brother, Choclo, the Lagartos appear to lack the internal organization necessary to project a unified front.But with the Choneros forced to fend off a rebellion from some of its proxy gangs, the Lagartos may have a chance to reorganize.

Cárteles Unidos,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/carteles-unidos/,Cárteles Unidos,,./images/organizations/cárteles-unidos.jpg,2022-07-18,"['mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"The Cárteles Unidos (CU) is a criminal organization that was born out of an alliance between the Cartel de Tepalcatepec, Los Viagras and other groups to combat advances made by the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG) into Mexico's state of Michoacán. It operates under a name previously used by other allied groups in the state to combat the Zetas. The CU is known for its involvement in illicit economies across Michoacán's Tierra Caliente region and efforts to keep the CJNG out of the state in an ongoing bloody turf war.","The roster of those working under the banner of “Cárteles Unidos” to combat a common enemy trying to break into Michoacán state has changed multiple times.In 2010, Sinaloa Cartel leader, Ignacio Coronel Villarreal, brought together members of the Sinaloa Cartel, Gulf Cartel and Knights Templar using this name. The grouping allied itself with Milenio Cartel members and operatives of the Familia Michoacana to stop the advance of the Zetas into the states of Michoacán and Jalisco.After pushing out the Zetas, these allied groups fragmented, and ultimately returned to fighting among each other. The latest incarnation of the CU was formed to stave off the CJNG's encroachment into western Michoacán, which intensified in 2019. The CJNG publicly declared war on the Cartel del Abuelo - a group local to Michoacán's southwestern municipality of Tepalcatepec, which began as a self-defense group but moved into drug trafficking - in mid-August 2019. Later that month, an hours-long firefight between the two groups forced businesses and schools to close, left 11 wounded and nine dead in Michoacán's western municipalities of Ixtlán and Tepalcatepec.In May 2020, media reports began to circulate that leader of the Cartel del Abuelo, Juan José Farías Álvarez, had called on vigilante groups in four municipalities across Michoacán to unite and resist the CJNG. Knowing it would be unable to win this battle alone, the Cartel del Abuelo joined forces with another CJNG rival, Los Viagras.Once a self-defense group, Los Viagras are now a known criminal enterprise. Intelligence reports have stated they engage in hired assassinations, extortion targeting ranchers and lime farmers, as well as marijuana and synthetic drug trafficking.The Cartel del Abuelo and Los Viagras are joined by cells of the Familia Michoacana, Knights Templar and White Trojans to fight the CJNG under the banner of ""Cárteles Unidos.""Since forming, the CU has been locked in an ongoing battle with the CJNG in western Michoacán, largely causing bloodshed in municipalities across its Tierra Caliente region. The allied group is fighting to keep control over drug trafficking routes running through the state and its share in local illicit economies including drug production and the extortion of avocado producers. In September 2020, CU operatives drove a military tank through the town of Bonifacio Moreno (also known as ""El Aguaje"") in Michoacán's southwestern municipality of Aguililla. At the time, they recorded themselves warning off CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias “El Mencho,” after allegedly killing a number of CJNG operatives. Two months later, local residents reported presumed members of Los Viagras had been digging trenches around the municipalities of Tepalcatepec and Coalcomán to stop CJNG vehicles from entering. Clashes between the two groups escalated again as 2020 came to an end. In early December, after the CJNG stormed a CU safe house in Los Reyes, armed confrontations between the two groups spread to three other municipalities: Cotija de la Paz, Tocumbo and Tingüindín. In Los Reyes, this battle reportedly involved multiple shootouts between operatives fighting aboard 40 trucks. The CU's stake in the synthetics drug trade has been a constant source of the ongoing conflict. In March 2021, a former mayor of the town of Aguililla was arrested for his role in brokering a multimillion-dollar deal on behalf of the CU to deliver half a ton of methamphetamine hidden in concrete tiles and house paint to south Florida by truck. Soon after, members of the CJNG – one of the main producers of synthetic drugs like methamphetamine – reportedly stormed Aguililla.","The CU is led by Juan José Farías Álvarez, alias “El Abuelo.” In his role as leader of the Cartel del Abuelo, he called for vigilante groups in four municipalities across Michoacán to unite and resist “invasion.” Farías Álvarez is no stranger to the state’s criminal landscape. He has been involved in Michoacán’s underworld since the 1990s, previously leading a self-defense group battling the Knights Templar from the Tierra Caliente region. Security forces and witnesses recognized him as a ""regional commander"" of the Milenio Cartel. Federal officials have previously claimed he intimidated authorities to build a wall of impunity around the organization. While he has been arrested on different occasions, Farías Álvarez has avoided spending time behind bars. He was arrested in 2009 on weapons and drugs charges. He was accused of controlling drug trafficking activities in the municipalities of Tepalcatepec, Sahuayo, Jiquilpan and Aguililla, as well as executing members of the Zetas and Familia Michoacana. Although he was sentenced to three years in prison, he had already served the time while on remand and his conviction was later quashed on appeal.He was arrested again in May 2018, when the Attorney General's Office accused him of crimes against health and carrying weapons for the exclusive use of the Army. Residents blocked roads to demand his release, which came days later. Interestingly, Farías Álvarez once allied himself with the CJNG as it initially moved into Michoacán. But this was long forgotten when the CJNG launched a series of bloody assaults against the Cartel del Abuelo in 2019, with El Mencho reportedly issuing a personal statement threatening Farías Álvarez. Despite his clash with the CJNG boss, Farías Álvarez still has some powerful connections. His brother Uriel, alias “El Paisa,” is a former mayor of Tepalcatepec and a founder of vigilante groups in that municipality. And in 2014, ""El Abuelo"" met with the Mexican government’s special security envoy to Michoacán, Alfredo Castillo Cervantes.Carlos Sierra Santana, and his brother Nicolás, alias ""El Gordo,"" are the known leaders of Los Viagras, suggesting he plays a senior role in the CU. ","The CU maintains an exclusive presence in Michoacán, given its deep roots there. Its principal objective is to defend its stake in illicit economies across the state's Tierra Caliente region by keeping the CJNG out.Tepalcatepec is a stronghold for the CU. The southwestern municipality sits along a strategic drug trafficking route. To the southeast, the Pacific coast town of Acapulco in Guerrero state and the Port of Lázaro Cárdenas in Michoacán are important. Precursor chemicals and drugs arrive there before transiting north through Michoacán and into Guadalajara, before reaching the United States. The municipality of Aguililla – also in southwestern Michoacán – is a hotly contested area that has been overrun by the CU and CJNG. Members of the CU have recorded themselves parading military tanks through the town of Bonifacio Moreno, also known as ""El Aguaje."" They have also reportedly left dead bodies of CJNG operatives in the town's streets. Since then, the CJNG appears to have moved in. In February 2021, members of the CU opened fire on CJNG operatives to stop them taking control of the towns of La Bocanda (just west of El Aguaje), and La Estanzuela, in the state's northern region.The CU has also battled its main rival in the western municipalities of Chinicuila, Apatzingán and Buenavista.Its presence extends to municipalities across northwestern Michoacán like Cotija de la Paz, Tocumbo, Tingüindín, Los Reyes and Tangancícuaro. ","The CU was born out of its desire to fight off its sworn enemy, the CJNG, and keep control of Michoacán's drug trade. This enmity is also underpinned by a personal rivalry between CU leader Farías Álvarez and former ally, El Mencho.Both groups want control of Michoacán's illicit economies – particularly critical trafficking routes cutting through the state that are used to feed the United States with synthetic drugs. The ongoing rivalry has been behind most violence in the state in 2020 and 2021. It has led to regular shootouts and displays of military might from both sides. The CU has dug trenches to keep the CJNG from encroaching on its strongholds. Meanwhile, the CJNG has retaliated by stealing military tanks. Both groups reportedly want access to drones to monitor their territories and attack each other with explosives as part of an ongoing arms race. This rivalry has also manifested itself as a war of words. Both sides have repeatedly posted threatening videos to address each other. And the CJNG publicly blamed the CU for a May 2021 road assault in Tepalcatepec which used weaponized drones packed with homemade explosives. The CU is a strategic alliance in itself, counting on cooperation between the groups that form it. Érick Valencia Salazar, alias “El 85,” has reportedly joined up with the group on occasion to help in its fight agains the CJNG, despite having previously allied with El Mencho.Los Viagras have previously allied with the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel to confront the CJNG in the state of Guanajuato, but this union was fragile. ","Even with the CJNG's superior financing, manpower, weaponry and political connections, the CU has largely been able to stop its main rival from taking hold of Michoacán state so far.Groups like the CU possess crucial information on safe houses, escape routes and enemy operatives, giving them a strategic advantage. The allied organization already has the loyalty of residents, which is critical to gathering intel and makes the CJNG’s potential takeover evermore difficult.While local residents may not have an interest in accepting the CJNG, the battle looks unlikely to end in the near future. It is likely to cause more bloodshed, as neither side looks likely to back down anytime soon.When the ongoing conflict does come to an end, so might the CU one way or another. Alliances formed in the past under this banner have been successful in ousting organizations trying to break into Michoacán’s illicit economies, most notably the Zetas.But if the most recent incarnation of the CU manages to kick the CJNG out of the state, it may repeat history and fragment back into individual groups.",
Shining Path,https://insightcrime.org/peru-organized-crime-news/shining-path-profile/,Shining Path,,./images/organizations/shining-path.jpg,2021-05-23,"['peru', 'peru groups', 'shining path']",peru,"The Shining Path or the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (Militarizado Partido Comunista de Peru - MPCP) is the last remnant of Peru’s guerrilla movement from the end of the 20th Century. Although the group is in decline, it still maintains influence in the VRAEM due to its drug trafficking alliances.On May 23, 2021, a splinter group from the Shining Path reportedly killed 16 people in the VRAEM and left behind pamphlets warning people not to vote in presidential elections scheduled for June 6, and especially not to vote for right-wing candidate Keiko Fujimori.","The Communist Party of Peru - Shining Path (PCP-SL), was formed in 1970 as a breakaway faction from the Peruvian Communist Party (PCP). It had only a few dozen members, led by Abimael Guzman, a philosophy professor at the University of Ayacucho who had visited China and was deeply influenced by the ideas of Mao Zedong. Guzman believed communism required the waging of a ""popular war"" and criticized members of the PCP who merely wanted to organize the workers.By 1980 his group had grown to more than 500 members, and was ready to declare war on the Peruvian state, burning several ballot boxes in a small town in Ayacucho province in May, the day before national elections. The group continued to carry out attacks, particularly on police stations, and, in December 1982, the army was sent into the region to fight them.Though the Shining Path remained small, with around 3,000 members at the peak of its power in 1990, it was responsible for the majority of the victims of the war that followed -- the Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that it killed some 31,000 people between 1980 and 2000. The group's methods were particularly brutal, including stoning victims to death, or placing them in boiling water. The Shining Path carried out massacres of peasant communities perceived as being against their struggle, as well as attacking the security forces and other representatives of the state. They quickly gained ground, and were present across vast swathes of Peru by the end of the 1980s.The tide of the war began to turn when Alberto Fujimori took office in 1990, and launched an assault on the rebels, which included locking up and torturing suspected sympathizers, as well as arming Peasant Patrols (Rondas Campesinas), which were rural self-defense forces who fought the guerrillas.Guzman was captured in a Lima dance studio in 1992, and later called on his followers to make a peace deal with the government. This precipitated a break in the group, with rebels based in the Apurimac, Ene and Mantaro River Valley (VRAEM) region declaring Guzman to be a traitor, while another group, based further north in the Huallaga Valley, remained loyal. The Shining Path’s activity died down significantly until the mid-2000s, when there was a resurgence, including attacks on multinational corporations, particularly from the VRAEM branch.The Shining Path no longer presents a serious threat to the stability of the Peruvian state, but the guerrillas' continued activities continue to pose a challenge for the government. The Huallaga faction, however, is thought to have been drastically weakened since the capture of its leader, Florindo Eleuterio Flores Hala, alias ""Comrade Artemio,"" in 2012. He was the last leader in the field who remained loyal to Guzman. Now there is no link between the rebels still in the field and the high commanders in prison.While the remnants of the Shining Path continue to espouse a Maoist ideology and to launch attacks on security forces, they now prefer to identify themselves as the Militarized Communist Party of Peru (Militarizado Partido Comunista del Perú - MPCP) in order to distance themselves from the history of the guerrilla and receive greater support from the rural farming communities. The guerrillas' primary revenue sources are offering protection and escort services for drug traffickers. The government describes the group in the VRAEM as nothing more than a drug gang, the situation is more complicated -- this faction continues to carry out propaganda activity and attacks on the security forces independent of protecting the drug business. On August 11, 2013, Peruvian officials announced the deaths of Orlando Alejandro Borda Casafranca, alias ""Alipio,"" and Marco Antonio Quispe Palomino, alias ""Gabriel,"" the number two and number four, respectively, of the VRAEM branch of the Shining Path. Alipio was the military head of the faction, and Gabriel was the brother of VRAEM faction leader Victor Quispe Palomino, known as ""Comrade Jose."" It appears both were killed by security forces during an operation in which a drug trafficker participated. The drug trafficker, who provided the group with logistical support, had become a police informant. Tarcela Loya Vilchez, alias ""Olga,"" became the second in command, taking the place of Alipio while another of Comrade José’s brothers, Jorge, alias “Comrade Raúl,” took charge of the political and ideological aspects of the organization. In 2008, the Army’s VRAEM Special Command was created as part of a militarization strategy in the fight against drugs and the Shining Path. Eleven years after the implementation of this program, it has still not achieved its objectives and for this reason current presidency of Martín Vizcarra has opted to try a new policy known as the VRAEM 2021 Strategy. The president has called for “pacifying” the country through an intervention in the VRAEM that combines military efforts with crop eradication, economic development, and poverty eradication programs.In March 2021, Jorge Quispe Palomino was killed in a military operation.The massacre of 16 people in May 2021 near the village of San Miguel del Ene marks a major return to violent actions by the Shining Path and is likely to be met with a swift response from the government.","Founder of the guerrilla group Abimael Guzman, alias “Gonzalo,” was captured in 1992, causing a division with the group. The Huallaga faction, led by Florindo Eleuterio Flores, alias “Comandante Artemio,” now in prison, remained loyal to Guzmán; the other faction in the VRAEM, led by the Quispe Palomino brothers, headed by Víctor, alias “Camarada José,” with his brother Jorge, also known as “Raúl” as second in command.Víctor Quispe Palomino was declared responsible by the Peruvian Army for the May 23, 2021 massacre carried out by Shining Path members in the VRAEM.","Currently, the remnant group of the Shining Path finds itself in a narrow but strategic drug trafficking corridor between the departments of Junín, Ayacucho and Huancavelica in the VRAEM, the country’s main drug producing region. The base of the Quispe Palomino brothers is in Vizcatán, in the heart of the jungle of the VRAEM, a strategic location for controlling key drug trafficking routes towards Brazil and Bolivia. ","At the beginning of the first decade of the 2000s, the Shining Path established links with the Colombian FARC guerrilla group, from whom they learned some war tactics, like the use of rocket launchers to shoot down military airplanes. Currently, the Shining Path has alliances and businesses with local drug trafficking clans from the VRAEM.In May 2021, Peru's President Francisco Sagasti ordered the deployment of armed forces into the VRAEM in response to the massacre of at least 16 people in San Miguel del Ene.","Although the Shining Path has announced a new strategy for seizing power in anticipation of the 2021 Bicentennial, it is very unlikely that it manages to do so as it does not have the military or economic strength to do so. The Shining Path has steadily weakened over the years. But its alliances with drug traffickers, control of strategic territories in the VRAEM and the resilience to years of military operations show that putting an end to this organization will not be an easy task for state security forces.The surprising massacre of at least 16 people in May 2021, attributed to the Shining Path, is certain to see a swift response from authorities and a crackdown in the VRAEM.",
Sinaloa Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/sinaloa-cartel-profile/,Sinaloa Cartel,,./images/organizations/sinaloa-cartel.jpg,2021-05-04,"['mexico groups', 'sinaloa cartel']",mexico,"The Sinaloa Cartel, often described as the largest and most powerful drug trafficking organization in the Western Hemisphere, is an alliance of some of Mexico's top capos. The coalition's members operate in concert to protect themselves, relying on connections at the highest levels and corrupting portions of the federal police and military to maintain the upper hand against rivals.","The state of Sinaloa has long been a center for contraband in Mexico, as well as a home for marijuana and poppy cultivation. Nearly all of the trafficking organizations in Mexico have their origins in the region. They were, in essence, a small group of farming families that lived in rural parts of the state. In the 1960s and 1970s, they moved from the contraband trade into drugs, particularly marijuana. One of the first to traffic marijuana in bulk was Pedro Aviles, who later brought his friend's son, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" into the business.Aviles was killed in a shootout with police in 1978. In the latter part of the 1970s, the various families branched into moving cocaine for Colombian and Central American traffickers, and shifted their operations to Guadalajara, in the state of Jalisco. Their leaders included Rafael Caro Quintero, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo and Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo. Working closely with the Honduran Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, the men came into contact with Colombia's Medellín Cartel. Matta Ballesteros lived part-time in Colombia, where he operated as the main intermediary between Mexican and Colombian traffickers, particularly the Medellín and Guadalajara Cartels. They established the patterns that we see repeated today: movement of bulk shipments of cocaine via airplane and boat to Central America and Mexico, then by land routes into the United States. The boldness of the Mexican traffickers became evident when they murdered undercover Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent Enrique Camarena in 1985.The death of Camarena was the beginning of the end of the Guadalajara Cartel. US pressure forced Mexican authorities to act, and the leaders of the cartel fled. The remaining factions established bases in various parts of Mexico. The Arellano Félix brothers set up camp in Tijuana. The Carrillo Fuentes family moved to Juarez. El Chapo and his partner, Héctor Luis Palma Salazar, remained in the Sinaloa area.The battles between these organizations began almost immediately. In November 1992, El Chapo sent 40 gunmen to raid a Tijuana Cartel party in Puerto Vallarta, killing nine people. The Tijuana Cartel responded by trying to assassinate El Chapo at the Guadalajara airport in 1993, killing a Mexican cardinal instead. El Chapo fled to Guatemala where he was arrested two weeks later. Palma Salazar was arrested in 1995.The operations remained under the auspices of El Chapo's brother Arturo Loera, Ramon Laija Serrano, and Hector, Alfredo and Arturo Beltran Leyva. El Chapo maintained some control from prison, passing messages through his lawyers. In 2001, he escaped prison, and assumed a central leadership role in the organization. Chapo was famously recaptured, then escaped from prison, then recaptured in Mexico once again in 2016, only adding to his criminal legend.In January 2017, El Chapo was extradited to the United States. His recapture and extradition has sparked a wave of violence due to internal power struggles within the Sinaloa Cartel and efforts from other criminal groups to expand their operations in the capo’s absence.Since then, there has been an internal power struggle between Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo,"" and El Chapo's sons, known as ""Los Chapitos."" While the Sinaloa Cartel remains under the leadership of Zambada García, its local bosses have broad decision-making power, which makes it difficult to estimate how much of an overall toll this violence has had on the group.","After the breakaway of the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) in 2008, El Chapo became the most visible head of the Sinaloa Cartel, although he was joined at the top table by El Mayo and Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, alias ""El Azul."" El Azul reportedly died of a heart attack in June 2014, although there are rumors that he is still alive and well.The Sinaloa Cartel is not a hierarchical structure. El Chapo, El Azul and El Mayo all maintained their own separate but cooperating organizations, while the cartel's operations in foreign countries, and even within Mexico, are often outsourced to local partners.El Chapo's capture and later extradition to the United States appears to have sparked an internal battle for control of the organization, as evidenced by a February 2017 attack against El Mayo and two of El Chapo's sons that was reportedly orchestrated by El Chapo's one-time right-hand man, Dámaso López Núñez, alias ""Licenciado.""However, El Licenciado and his son, Damáso López Serrano, alias “Mini Lic,” have both been arrested and are now in US custody. Given that El Chapo's conviction in the United States in 2019 landed him in prison for the rest of his life, El Mayo, the only remaining member from the Sinaloa Cartel's old guard, and El Chapo's sons, Joaquín Guzmán López, Ovidio Guzmán López, Iván Archivaldo and Jesús Alfredo, who are also known collectively as ""Los Chapitos,"" are now left to head the general direction of the cartel's operations while it retains its horizontal structure.In 2020, divisions between Los Chapitos and El Mayo appeared to worsen, with a number of deadly clashes reported between their supporters as well as the mysterious assassination of a former top Sinaloa Cartel hitman. In contrast, El Mayo's sons have either all been arrested and jailed in the United States or seem to be lying low.","The Sinaloa Cartel's tentacles stretch from New York City to Buenos Aires and almost every major city in between. The cartel was founded in Mexico's Sinaloa state and now operates in 17 Mexican states, and by some estimates, in as many as 50 countries.","The Sinaloa Cartel's central bond is blood. Many of its members are related by birth or by marriage. However, the cartel also often acts more like a federation than a tightly knit organization. The core of the group, the BLO, split from the rest in 2008. The Sinaloa Cartel has since created new alliances with former enemies in the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana and appears to have negotiated a pact with what remains of the Tijuana Cartel.The Sinaloa Cartel seems to have taken its cue from Colombia's Cali Cartel by establishing strong connections to Mexico's political and economic elite. It has successfully penetrated government and security forces wherever it operates. It often opts for the bribe over the bullet and alliances over fighting, but it is not above organizing its forces to overrun areas that it wants to control by force.The cartel's most powerful contacts have traditionally been in the National Action Party (Partido Acción Nacional - PAN), which, according to some sources, helps account for its growth in the last decade. The PAN's Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderon launched numerous offensives against trafficking organizations, and some major leaders have been captured, including Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, head of the Gulf Cartel, and Benjamin Arellano Félix, head of the Tijuana Cartel. So strong is the perception that the PAN favors the Sinaloa Cartel that Mexican justice officials issued a press release in 2010 denying it, while the Calderon government produced a video in 2011 with the same intention.Today, the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG), is the Sinaloa Cartel's primary enemy. The CJNG emerged out of the Sinaloa Cartel in 2010 after the death of former Sinaloa Cartel capo Ignacio Coronel, alias “Nacho.” Since, the CJNG has expanded rapidly across the country, involving itself in a host of criminal activities, including international drug trafficking, most recently involving synthetic drugs and powerful opioids like fentanyl, which the Sinaloa Cartel is also involved in the trafficking of.It remains to be seen if the Sinaloa Cartel can again claim the spot as the country's most dominant cartel, but right now the Sinaloa Cartel and CJNG stand together as Mexico's two most dominant organized crime groups.","In recent years, the Sinaloa Cartel has become embroiled in a series of violent turf wars. In 2012, the cartel emerged victorious from a bloody battle with the Juarez Cartel over control of Ciudad Juarez. However, the war with rival cartel the Zetas, who in some regions have allied themselves with the remnants of the BLO, has spread across the country and raged through the states of Sinaloa, Durango, Coahuila, Nuevo Leon, and Jalisco, even reaching into Guatemala. The upper hand in the conflict has ebbed and flowed throughout the regions but with the Zetas an increasingly fragmented force, the Sinaloa Cartel seems poised to cement its position as the dominant force in the Mexican underworld.Even with El Chapo in jail for life, the Sinaloa Cartel has remained one of Mexico's most powerful organized crime groups. However, the days of big cartels in Mexico may be numbered. As the country's criminal landscape continues to grow more fragmented, it's unclear if and how traditional cartels will be forced to adapt.",
Bagdad,https://insightcrime.org/panama-organized-crime-news/bagdad-profile/,Bagdad,,./images/organizations/bagdad.jpg,2021-05-05,"['bagdad', 'panama', 'panama groups']",panama,"Bagdad, along with its rival Calor Calor, is one of Panama’s two main gang federations, consisting of 30-40 smaller gangs that work together to fulfill drug transportation across Panama for larger transnational crime groups.However, the gangs that make up Bagdad do not have deep internal loyalty and often feud over microtrafficking in Panama City and other areas of the country.","Bagdad's origins go back to the Unión Soviética gang, itself a combination of smaller gangs named Bagdad, El Pentágono and Matar o Morir (MOM). Led by Jorge Rubén Camargo Clarke, alias ""Cholo Chorrillo"" or ""El Cholo,"" Bagdad became notorious ""tumbadores"" -- gangs specialized in stealing drug shipments from trafficking groups. Bagdad was original based in El Chorrillo, while El Pentágono operated in Santa Ana and MOM in Curundú, all neighborhoods of Panama City.Unión Soviética also extorted other criminal groups and fought to eliminate other gangs and tumbadores. Its enemies eventually rallied together to form ""Calor Calor,"" starting a rivalry that continues to this day.After the leaders of El Pentágono and MOM were killed, Bagdad took over the federation and its name stuck.Bagdad still engages in drug theft but the gang's main activities now consist of controlling territory for the movement and sale of drugs. According to the Panama Attorney General's Office, in 2021, Bagdad charged between 5 to 10 percent of the price of cocaine shipments that they transported through the country. In 2014, InSight Crime research estimated the federation controlled over 50 percent of drug sales in Panama. Bagdad also provides services such as guarding shipments and contract killings, and engages in kidnapping and extortion. The gang recruits young people from about 14 years of age.Bagdad and Calor Calor together were estimated to have more than 2,000 members in 2014.","Jorge Rubén Camargo Clarke, alias ""Cholo Chorrillo,"" was the notorious leader of the Unión Soviética group and once ruled over Bagdad. The current leader of Bagdad is Jaime Powell Rodriguez, alias “Yunya,” who took over around 2016.According to InSight Crime field research, Yunya fancies himself a drug kingpin. He is known for being well-dressed and maintaining a public businessman persona, while actually using his network of businesses in Spain to ship drugs to Europe and launder money, which he hides in Swiss bank accounts.In 2018, Powell Rodriguez was arrested in Dubai and extradited to Panama on charges of transnational drug trafficking but was released in March 2019. In May 2020, Panamanian police were searching for him once again.In 2021, Camargo Clarke was out of jail once more and was one of the main targets of Operation Neptune, a joint investigation into Bagdad by Panamanian authorities and the US Drug Enforcement Administration. He appeared to flee the country with other senior Bagdad commanders to avoid arrest. Camargo Clarke was finally arrested in February 2022 in Costa Rica. He is awaiting extradition to the United States.","Originally based in Panama City, Bagdad is now strongest across the canal in West Panama province, which borders with Panama City, Colón and the Pacific Ocean. The violent territorial conflict between Bagdad and Calor Calor has expanded from Panama City into West Panama, where drug shipments enter and leave from La Chorrera coastal area.Bagdad and Calor Calor members often live in close proximity.","Bagdad is made up of numerous youth gangs. Groups that have been described as allies of Bagdad include ""El Pentágono,"" ""Vietnam 23,"" and ""Nadie ta' Bien."" Its main rival is Calor Calor, itself an agglomeration of groups.The two organizations are the biggest criminal blocs in Panama and their rivalry centers around control of strategically located ports, shares of the international drug trade, especially the European market and over the personal rivalry between Yunya and the leader of Calor Calor, Eduardo Macea, alias Marshall.Yunya and Marshall started out working together under Juan Vicente Blandford, alias El Pátron Juancito, but began fighting in 2014, when members of Calor Calor’s structure moved to Bagdad. Yunya has the reputation of being the less violent of the two criminals, while Marshall has a reputation for ruthlessness.  El Pátron Juancito was captured in 2019, but is, reportedly, still trying to unite the two from within prison.Since 2019, Bagdad has also had to deal with an internal rift, as one of its member-gangs, Matar o Morir (Kill or Be Killed – MOM) kept a shipment of drugs for themselves as a declaration of independence.In December of 2019 Bagdad retaliated by orchestrating a shootout in La Joyita, one of Panama’s largest high-security prisons. One group of prisoners opened fire on another, using high-caliber assault weapons and leaving 15 dead and 11 more injured.The incident became known as the “La Joyita Massacre,” and has set off a wave violence that both continues to flare up in the La Joya prison complex, but which has also spilled into the streets of Panama Oeste and caused homicides rates to skyrocket.Since then, Bagdad has drawn the wrong kind of attention from the DEA, which has a long track record of dismantling drug gangs in Central America once they reach a certain size.","Bagdad’s operations in transnational drug trafficking have become more sophisticated and its role has changed from a subordinate to a subcontractor that brokers shipment of drugs for Colombian and Mexican groups through Panama and beyond, according to InSight Crime field research. Though Bagdad is likely to remain a middleman in the transnational drug trade, the business is lucrative, and the stakes are getting higher.Because there is more money to be made than when they were first formed Bagdad, as well as its rival Calor Calor, has responded by consolidating power and upping the violence. However, the scale of violence involved in the La Joyita massacre may have marked a turning point. In April 2021, US and Panamanian authorities carried out large-scale raids, targeting Bagdad leadership, after a year-long investigation, which involved tapping phones, identifying front businesses and money laundering techniques. It is uncertain how Bagdad will be able to stand up to such pressure. ",
Libertadores del Vichada,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/libertadores-del-vichada/,Libertadores del Vichada,,./images/organizations/libertadores-del-vichada.jpg,2021-04-23,"['colombia', 'colombia groups', 'libertadores del vichada']",libertadores,"The Libertadores del Vichada were a splinter group of the Popular Revolutionary Anti-Terrorist Army of Colombia (ERPAC), based in Colombia's Eastern Plains. The criminal organization oversaw a substantial drug empire, including cocaine processing laboratories, coca cultivation and drug trafficking routes, as well as a network of hitmen.However, as of 2017, according to Colombian authorities, the group has been successfully dismantled.","The Libertadores del Vichada were one of two main splinter groups that formed following the dissolution of the ERPAC, which itself emerged in the wake of the demobilization of paramilitary umbrella group the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) in the mid-2000s. Initially, the ERPAC was led by Pedro Oliveiro Guerrero, alias ""Cuchillo,"" and until his death in 2010, it controlled a significant portion of the drug trade in the Eastern Plains region.A year after Cuchillo's death, his successor, Jose Eberto Lopez Montero, alias ""Caracho,"" turned himself in with some 260 ERPAC fighters. By February 2012, the remaining ERPAC members had formed into two main splinter groups, the Libertadores del Vichada and the Meta Bloc, numbering around 560 fighters in total.The Libertadores del Vichada were then taken over by Martin Farfan Diaz Gonzalez, alias ""Pijarbey"" – Cuchillo's former military leader and second-in-command – following his release from prison.Under Pijarbey's leadership, the group fought against the Meta Bloc for control of ERPAC's coca crops, cocaine laboratories and trafficking routes to Venezuela. The Libertadores del Vichada allied themselves with the Urabeños, while the Meta Bloc had the support of powerful drug lord Daniel Barrera, alias ""El Loco."" Both Barrera and Meta Bloc leader Rubber Antonio Navarro Caicedo, alias ""Flaco Fredy,"" were captured in September 2012, positioning the Libertadores del Vichada to take over ERPAC's former territories.The Libertadores del Vichada have also been linked to extortion and to a fuel theft network dismantled in July 2014. The network allegedly infiltrated transnational oil company Pacific Rubiales and stole up to 200 gallons a day for use in Pijarbey's cocaine laboratories.Although the group appears to be expanding its reach, it also suffered a series of blows in 2013 and 2014, with the captures of numerous high ranking members. This downward spiral continued with the death of Pijarbey in 2015 and, by 2017, the group ceased to be a functional criminal threat.","Since the death of Martín Farfán Díaz Gonzales, alias “Pijarbey” in 2015, and his second-in-command, alias ""Movil 7,"" in 2017, the group has constantly changed leadership as a result of the actions of public security forces, as has happened with aliases “Tigre,” “Caratejo,” “Wilmar,” “Perla” y “El Mexicano.”In the first half of 2020, two of the highest ranking leaders were arrested, leaving Los Libertadores without a single defined leader.The name ""Libertadores del Vichada"" has continued to be used by Colombian authorities, in connection to certain arrests, but it is uncertain to what extent any of its former members are re-using the name.","The main area of operation for the Libertadores was the region known as the Eastern Plains, which incorporates the departments of Meta, Vichada, and Guaviare.","The Libertadores were allied with the Urabeños and may also have had ties to the Oficina de Envigado, a Medellin-based drug network. Authorities began to investigate this relationship after key Oficina operative, alias ""Cesarin,"" sought refuge in the Libertadores' territory.The panorama of the Eastern Plains, particularly on the Venezuelan border, led to the group establishing alliances with structures within the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN) and the ex-FARC Mafia, with regard to the coordination of criminal activity and the provision of certain services, such as security or enforcing justice in the territories they control.The Libertadores' main enemies were rival ERPAC splinter groups, such as the Meta Bloc, and other smaller criminal structures.","The Libertadores del Vichada controlled a lucrative drug empire, including profitable trafficking routes to Venezuela, which allowed their leaders to form alliances with other criminal groups from around the region in regards to drug shipments.Today, while the name ""Libertadores del Vichada"" has continued to surface in police reports and media articles about the arrests of drug traffickers in Vichada, it is uncertain to what extent former members are re-using the name as part of a new criminal group.",
EPL,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/epl/,EPL,,./images/organizations/epl.jpg,2022-07-15,"['colombia groups', 'colombia mafia', 'epl']",colombia,"The EPL, also known as Los Pelusos, is an armed group mainly based in Catatumbo, a region of Colombia’s northern department of Norte de Santander, where it is mostly involved in drugs and arms trafficking.In early 2021, the group suffered repeated blows in battles with Colombian armed forces and criminal rivals. It is now no longer considered a major national security threat and is unlikely to ever get back to that level.","The Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL) emerged in 1967 as the armed wing of the Colombian Communist Party. The guerrilla group succeeded in gaining a following among workers and rural communities by preaching Mao Zedong’s ""Three Worlds Theory,"" which argued that the developing countries of the third world must ally with those of the second world in order to defeat the hegemony of the United States and, at the time, the Soviet Union.In the early 1980s, the EPL began to distance itself from its former Maoist principles, prioritizing political struggle over armed resistance. In addition, the EPL’s strategy moved from traditional guerrilla warfare to one focused on inciting popular insurrection, with Colombian cities and towns becoming more important to their armed struggle.Along with these changes, the EPL also embarked on a plan to expand its presence at the national and international level. As a result, the rebel group began to establish a presence in the Catatumbo and Putumayo regions as well as in other countries like Venezuela and Ecuador.Finally, on March 1, 1991, 2,200 members of the guerrilla group demobilized and formed a political party called Esperanza, Paz, y Libertad (Hope, Peace and Liberty.)However, a group of guerrillas within the EPL rejected this peace agreement. This marked the beginning of the current incarnation of the Pelusos. This included one of its founders, Francisco Caraballo, who had extensive experience commanding EPL structures all over Colombia. But his capture in 1994, continued pressure from armed forces and prime drug trafficking routes being contested by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) and paramilitary groups prevented the EPL from growing into a real transnational force.","One of the EPL’s most important commanders was Victor Ramón Navarro, alias “Megateo,” who led the group from 2005 to October 2015, when he was killed in an operation by security forces. Since then, no leader has managed to keep a hold on power for long, which has contributed to the group’s woes. Navarro’s successor, Guillermo León Aguirre, alias “David León,” was captured in Medellín on December 15, 2016. The next one, Jade Navarro Barbaso, alias “Caracho,” lasted a mere 40 days.In 2019 and 2020, internal divisions have worsened within the EPL as its members have been divided between its traditional “guerrilla” faction still located in Catatumbo, Norte de Santander, and another faction focused on drug trafficking at the Colombia-Venezuela border, based in Cúcuta.This division has been worsened by more deaths and arrests among senior commanders. In October 2019, the Colombian army killed then-leader Luis Antonio Quiceno Sanjuan, alias “Pácora,” More recently, Pácora's successor, Richard Arley Díaz Garay, alias “Cóndor,” was captured in Norte de Santander.","The EPL has maintained a regular, if diminished presence, in Catatumbo and along the Venezuelan border. However, ongoing battles with the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional -- ELN) has forced them to withdraw to the municipalities of Ocaña, Abrego, Sardinata and Hacarí, as well as the metropolitan area of Cúcuta and Puerto Santander.From 2017 to 2019, it seems the EPL sought to make inroads into other parts of Colombia, specifically the strategic drug corridor of El Naya, far to the south of its usual base of operations. However, authorities dismissed this link and claimed the EPL never established a firm foothold in El Naya.","Under the rule of Navarro, the EPL sought to maximize its drug trafficking profits by establishing alliances with the FARC and the Urabeños in Catatumbo. This alliance allowed the EPL to move drugs freely along routes connecting Catatumbo to Venezuela, to then be smuggled on to to Central America and the United States.Since 2018, the group has battled the ELN for control of territory and criminal proceeds in Catatumbo. As of January 2021, it is uncertain what remaining criminal economies or drug routes the EPL continues to operate, since it has lost a lot of ground.In April 2021, the Colombian government downgraded the EPL’s threat level from an organized armed group (Grupo Armado Organizado – GAO) to an Organized Criminal Group (Grupo Delictivo Organizado – GDO), meaning fewer resources and men would be deployed to fight it.","With no leader able to maintain a hold on the group for long, with its membership internally divided and unable to stand up to pressure from the ELN and Colombian armed forces, the EPL’s days as a criminal force may be numbered.It is unlikely that its membership will disappear and the risk is that they will either fragment into newer, smaller criminal gangs or join larger organizations such as the ELN.",
Choneros,https://insightcrime.org/ecuador-organized-crime-news/los-choneros/,Choneros,,./images/organizations/choneros.jpg,2021-10-04,"['ecuador', 'ecuador groups']",ecuador,"The Choneros is one of Ecuador’s most prominent criminal groups, which first emerged in the late 1990s as a drug trafficking organization based in the city of Manta, a beach town on Ecuador’s Pacific coast. Authorities originally identified the group as an armed branch of a Colombian drug cartel, with control over pacific maritime trafficking routes to Mexico and the US. However, the arrest of gang leaders in 2011, and their subsequent integration into the penitentiary system, sparked a decade of evolution for the Choneros.Since 2011, the Choneros have evolved into one of the country’s fiercest prison gangs, with a permanent presence in penitentiaries across Ecuador, as well as operations in multiple cities, where the Choneros engage in micro-trafficking, contract killings, extortion and contraband. Ecuador’s attempts to curb gang violence in prisons accelerated the expansion of the Choneros, leading to the establishment of loyal, derivative gangs, which has enhanced their influence.However, recent changes in the Choneros' leadership has sparked in-fighting between the group and its derivative gangs, threatening to unravel their legacy of power. In 2021, the group has been targeted by a coalition of smaller gangs.","The Choneros emerged in the 1990s in Chone, a city in Ecuador’s western province of Manabí, where the group’s founder, Jorge Busmarck Véliz España, alias “Teniente España,” was raised and began his criminal career as a small-time drug dealer. As his career advanced, Teniente España expanded his territory and operation, eventually coming to control international drug trafficking routes on the beaches of Manta, Ecuador, a Pacific coastal city in Manabí. According to Ecuadorian authorities, the Choneros served as an armed branch of a Colombian drug cartel, trafficking drugs along maritime routes to Mexico and the United States. The group also created a name for itself in cities around its stronghold of Manta, where the group carried out robberies, kidnappings, extortion, and contract killing.In the early 2000s, the Choneros grew in strength as the group clashed with rivals to maintain control over Pacific drug trafficking routes. Confrontations with Los Queseros, an early rival, sharpened the Choneros’ use of violence, after conflicts between the groups culminated in the assassination of Teniente España’s wife – a hit ordered by the leader of Los Queseros, Carlos Vera Cedeño. Following his wife’s death, Teniente España and the Choneros unleased a war on Los Queseros, which saw dozens of Los Queseros members killed, including its leader. Cedeño’s wife was the only one spared.In 2007, Teniente España was killed in a clash with Los Queseros in Santo Domingo, Manabí. His death sparked a series of leadership changes in the Choneros, as police operations and assassinations carried out by rival gangs unseated consecutive leaders. In the early 2010s, Jorge Luis Zambrano, alias Rasquiña, who had initially assumed command of the Choneros following the death of Teniente España, reemerged as the group’s leader, despite his capture and imprisonment in 2011. Rasquiña’s leadership initiated a decade of transition for the Choneros; as more gang members were arrested in targeted police operations, and with Rasquiña distributing orders from behind bars, the Choneros slowly morphed into a prison gang, although the group maintained its presence in the streets. This shifting dynamic also reoriented the group’s focus from international drug trafficking to micro-trafficking, contract killings, extortion, and contraband.In 2019, the Choneros regained national attention, as escalating violence in prisons led President Lenín Moreno to declare a prison crisis and mobilize Ecuador’s military to mitigate gang wars. One facet of Ecuador’s strategy was to transfer gang leadership and violent members throughout the penitentiary system to disarticulate the hierarchical leaderships structures of prison gangs. However, in effect, the mass transfer of prisoners led to the creation of derivative gangs in Ecuador’s penitentiary system, multiplying the presence of gang wars across the country.","While the Choneros’ leadership structure was once centralized and explicitly hierarchical, with Teniente España issuing commands, in recent years, the group’s expansion across Ecuador has troubled a strictly linear chain of command.Following President Lenín Moreno’s declaration of Ecuador’s prison crisis in May 2019, multiple efforts have been made to disarticulate prison gangs by transferring leaders and dangerous members between prisons. This distribution has resulted in the emergence of numerous derivative gangs, each of which operates under a distinct leadership structure in its respective prison and accompanying region of influence. Proxy wars between derivate gangs and their corresponding rivals have demonstrated how these various gangs operate under the umbrella of the Choneros. However, the assassination of the Choneros' leader, Jorge Luis Zambrano, alias Rasquiña, on December 28, 2020, has triggered an internal battle between derivative gangs and the fragile leadership of the Choneros.On February 23, 2021, in a coordinated attack across three prisons, inmates pertaining to Los Choneros' derivative gangs targeted members of Los Choneros, leaving 75 inmates dead in what was the largest prison riot in Ecuador's history. The attacks underscore the evolving nature of the Choneros' leadership structure, which, weakened by the death of Rasquiña, is now facing challenges from its own ranks.","Historically, the Choneros’ criminal economies have been concentrated in Ecuador’s western province of Manabí – specifically, in the city Manta and its surrounding areas, where the Choneros rose to prominence in the late 1990s. However, as members of the Choneros began to increasingly populate Ecuador’s penitentiary system around 2011, the group’s nascent transformation into a prison gang began to shift its illicit activities south, to the province of Guayas, where the Choneros’ leadership was jailed in the La Roca Prison of Guayaquil.In 2019, Ecuador’s efforts to stem prison violence facilitated another shift in the Choneros’ territorial control, as gang leaders were transferred to prisons across the country to disarticulate hierarchical leadership structures in penitentiaries. However, this initiative facilitated the Choneros’ expansion, as derivate gangs arose in prisons in Esmeraldas, Cotopaxi, Guayaquil and Cuenca. Authorities now report that the Choneros exert influence in six provinces, including Manabí, Guayas, Los Ríos, El Oro, Santa Elena and Esmeraldas. The Choneros and its derivate gangs also have a presence on the streets in Daule, Naranjal, Balao, Milagro, Dúran, El Empalme and Balzar, as confirmed by numerous arrests.The Choneros also had the ability to move cocaine shipments from the Colombian border with Ecuador to the port of Guayaquil in six hours, making them valuable partners to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel. ","From the late 1990s until the late 2000s, the Choneros’ primary rival was Los Queseros. Prior to the arrival of Teniente España and the Choneros in Manta, Ecuador, Los Queseros controlled drug distribution in Manta’s plaza – a strategic drug trafficking location, which sparked confrontations between the two groups.Since its inception as a prison gang, the Choneros’ chief rival has been Los Lagartos – a similarly violent gang with factions across the country. The rivalry between Los Choneros and Los Lagartos serves as Ecuador’s contemporary fault line of violence – a catalyst for rising murder rates that have plagued the country in recent years. Ongoing gang wars between the Choneros, Los Lagartos and their respective proxy gangs, made 2020 the bloodiest year on record for inmates, with prison violence claiming lives on both sides.Prison gangs in Ecuador define themselves along this fault line, which has spawn similarly fierce rivalries among both groups’ derivate gangs across the country. In Esmeraldas, Los Choneros’ ally gang, the Tiguerones, battles with Los Lagartos’ derivate, Los Gánster Negros. In the streets of Dúran, Guayas, Los ChoneKillers – a particularly former violent branch of Los Choneros – frequently clash with the Latin Kings. In Cuenca, Los Lobos were loyal to Los Choneros and in Guacamo, Guayaquil, El Cuartel de las Feas is associated with Los Lagartos.The Choneros have also had a longstanding relationship with the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico, which used the gang's connections to rapidly move drugs from the Colombian border to the port of Guayaquil, according to the Washington Post. However, the coordinated attacks on February 23, 2021, carried out by Los Choneros' proxy gangs against their progenitor, suggests a shifting center of power among the Los Choneros faction in Ecuador's prisons. It appears that a number of groups once loyal to the Choneros have now turned on them, including the Chone Killers, Tiguerones and Lobos. This campaign against the Choneros continued in September 2021, with the Lobos leading attacks in a prison in Guayaquil which left 118 dead. According to Ecuadorean media reports, gangs once allied to the Choneros, including the Lobos, the Tiguerones, the Chone Killers and the Pipos have united in a new structure called New Generation (Nueva Generación) in 2021, in reference to their drug trafficking relationship with Mexico's Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación - CJNG).","Los Choneros’ transformation from a drug trafficking group in Manabí to an expansive prison gang with loyal derivatives across Ecuador, marks a resurgence for the group. However, the Choneros are facing a real crisis as its most important sub-groups have rebelled and are now fighting for control of Ecuador's drug trafficking. In recent years, Los Choneros appear to have migrated from its historic stronghold in Manta, Ecuador, to the southern province of Guayas – specifically, the capital of Guayaquil, which is the country’s drug trafficking hub. Guayaquil is also the historic stronghold of Los Lagartos, the group’s chief rival, who is engaged in an all-out war with the Choneros for control of criminal economies.Despite repeated efforts by Ecuador’s authorities to disarticulate gangs, the bifurcated structure of the Choneros – operating in prisons, as well as on the streets – has rendered successive attempts futile, with the group’s diffuse structure proving elusive. However, as the Choneros drive up levels of violence in Ecuador, the group is sure to invite greater government scrutiny. Violence in Ecuador’s penitentiary system has entered crisis levels and the crescendo of violence in 2021 has made the Choneros synonymous with one of Ecuador's chief problems: prison violence. This internecine warfare has left over 300 prisoners dead in 2021, an escalation that Ecuador is ill-equipped to deal with. It is uncertain how the Choneros will be able to withstand such pressure.",
Escritório do Crime,https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/escritorio-do-crime/,Escritório do Crime,,./images/organizations/escritório-do-crime.jpg,2021-08-13,"['brazil groups', 'brazil militias']",brazil,"Escritório do Crime is one of the largest and most powerful militia groups in Brazil’s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro. In recent years, the group has gained notoriety for a series of high-profile contract killings, most notably the murder of councilwoman Marielle Franco in August 2018. Despite the capture and death of certain top leaders, it continues to be one of Rio’s dominant criminal forces and appears set on expanding its presence even further.The membership of Escritório do Crime (Office of Crime) is largely made up of former and serving police officers working primarily as hitmen. Still, their criminal portfolio extends to drug trafficking, extortion and other organized crime activities.","Rio’s infamous militias have their roots in the brutal death squads that emerged during Brazil's military dictatorship from the 1960s to the 1980s. They were initially formed to protect residents living in gang-controlled favelas, but many later became involved in drug trafficking, extortion and other criminal activities. They have also now established a monopoly over internet service, cable TV, public transport and construction.Over the past decade, these paramilitary-style groups have expanded dramatically, and today they control large swaths of Rio de Janeiro and other large cities in Brazil. An estimated 57 percent of Rio’s metropolitan area is under the control of militias. As a result, some 3.7 million people live in militia-controlled zones.Escritório do Crime was created in the mid-2000s by Adriano Magalhães da Nóbrega, alias “Capitão Adriano.” Nóbrega was a former member of the Special Operations Police Battalion (Batalhão de Operações Policiais Especiais — BOPE).In 2005, he received Rio de Janeiro’s highest honor, the Tiradentes Medal, from Bolsonaro’s son, senator Flavio Bolsonaro, while in jail on a homicide conviction. According to police, Adriano participated in at least eight homicides between 2006 and 2009, at the behest of José Luiz de Barros Lopes, known as “Zé Personal.”And between 2009 and 2016,  three of the group’s key members – Adriano, João André and Batoré – allegedly carried out a series of contract killings. But in March 2016, João, considered the right-hand man of Adriano, was killed as he was leaving a bakery in Rio’s northern zone.The militia group made headlines in August 2018 when it was linked to the murder of Marielle Franco and her driver, Anderson Gomes. Franco was a councilwoman who had been an outspoken critic of police brutality in Rio de Janeiro’s marginalized favelas.In March 2019, two former police officers with ties to Escritório do Crime were arrested in connection with the murder of Marielle Franco. Ronnie Lessa, a former police sergeant and expert sniper, was accused of shooting Franco, while Élcio de Queiroz, a former military police officer, allegedly acted as Lessa’s driver. Adriano Nóbrega was one of the alleged intellectual authors of the murder.On the same day that Lessa was arrested, police found 117 M-16 assault rifles at a Rio home linked to Lessa when they raided it. Investigators said that Lessa was a contract killer and gunrunner for the militia group, who had been forced to retire from the police after being severely injured in a car bomb attack.Ronnie Lessa had been living in the same luxury condominium building where Bolsonaro owns an apartment. What’s more, in January 2019, it emerged that Flávio Bolsonaro, the eldest son of President Jair Bolsonaro, had employed the wife and mother of the militia group’s founder, “Capitão Adriano.” As well as being implicated in the murder of Marielle Franco, Adriano Nóbrega also allegedly participated in a salary kick-back scheme, known as “rachadinha,” involving Flávio Bolsonaro.An operation, dubbed “The Untouchables” (Os Intocáveis), was carried out in January 2019 to arrest key militia members operating in the Rio das Pedras favela. Among the five people arrested was the military police officer Ronaldo Paulo Alves Pereira, who allegedly took part in the assassination of Marielle Franco.In August 2021, amid a broad crackdown on militia operations in Rio de Janeiro, police arrested Edmilson Gomes Menezes, alias ""Macaquinho."" He was said to be Escritorio do Crime's boss in much of the north and west of the city and having been linked to the murder of Marielle Franco.","Escritório do Crime exercises high levels of criminal governance over the Rio das Pedras favela by providing essential services and engaging in extortion rackets and murder-for-hire operations. According to police investigations, the militia group was charging up to 1.5 million reais ($300,000) per victim.The criminal group has a monopoly over illegal gas sales, Internet access, transportation, mining and even oil theft. The extortion money is then used to fund illegal real estate in Rio de Janeiro.In April 2019, two residential buildings collapsed in the community of Muzema in Rio de Janeiro, killing at least four people. A police operation revealed that the buildings had been constructed illegally. A further investigation revealed that Escritório do Crime had financed the construction of a number of these buildings, selling illegal apartments off for thousands of dollars.","The current leader of the criminal group is unknown. Adriano Magalhães da Nóbrega, alias “Capitão Adriano,” was the notorious alleged leader of Escritório do Crime until his death in February 2020.Then, Leonardo Gouvêa da Silva, alias “Mad,” took over as the top leader until his arrest in June 2020 in an operation along with his brother Leandro Gouvêa da Silva, alias “Tonhão.” The brothers allegedly had a very close relationship with Capitão Adriano.","The Escritório do Crime group’s base of operations is the Rio das Pedras favela in Rio’s West Zone.While Rio de Janeiro is widely known as the militia stronghold, several Brazilian news outlets have analyzed data that suggests militias are expanding their territorial control and criminal activities across Brazil.According to an analysis of data acquired from Disque 100, a reporting line for Brazil’s Human Rights Ministry that records complaints of crimes and human rights violations, militia activity was reported in 15 states across the country between 2016 and 2017.","Militia groups in Rio de Janeiro have strong ties to public officials and security forces, allowing them to operate with impunity. The country’s recent municipal elections were marked by violence as militias sought to infiltrate the electoral process.  ","Militia groups continue to expand their influence in Rio de Janeiro and other large cities, posing an increasingly significant threat to Brazil’s national security. While its top leader, Adriano Nóbrega, is dead, Escritório do Crime looks set to continue its operations as it forges closer alliances with local politicians and collects even more extortion payments from communities and businesses."
Border Security Colectivo,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/border-security-colectivo/,Border Security Colectivo,,./images/organizations/border-security-colectivo.jpg,2021-09-22,['venezuela groups'],venezuela,"The Border Security Colectivo (Colectivo de Seguridad Fronteriza – CSF) was a state-supported irregular militia group based in the Colombian border state of Táchira. Following the killing of its leader, Óscar Rangel, alias “Cachú,” in May 2021, it is believed that the CSF has ceased to exist as a functional group unit.Since its establishment in 2018, it proved an essential tool in the Maduro regime’s strategy to regain control over criminal economies along the border with Colombia and to subdue the opposition’s attempts to promote social protests.From its stronghold in Táchira, the CSF protected the Maduro regime’s illegal revenues on the border by controlling informal border crossings, or “trochas” (trails). The group also coordinated with local political leaders to suppress opposition protests in Táchira, a state whose large migration flows have rendered it a hub for humanitarian assistance. By controlling the strategic state of Táchira, the CSF acted as an effective tool to repel actions by opposition leaders and international coalitions, without risking cross-border confrontations with military forces.","The Border Security Colectivo was one of the most recent iterations of government-sponsored armed groups that act to protect the Maduro regime’s interests across Venezuela. While the CSF lacked the community-based organizational structure typical of colectivos, the group shared its ideological roots in Chavismo, as well as their militant and political practices.In 2018, Freddy Bernal was appointed the “Protector of Táchira” by Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, granting him power over military, social and economic policies in the state. Bernal has been involved with the promotion and training of colectivos since his time as mayor of Caracas (2000-2008), and is believed to have been the political godfather of the CSF.A few months after Bernal was designated the “Protector of Táchira,” the BCSF  emerged and quickly proved its efficacy as a tool to repress the political opposition. In January 2019, the group intimidated protestors following the declaration of Juan Guaidó as interim president and later attempted to stop humanitarian aid coming in via the international bridges along the border.In 2019, the CSF has took advantage of border closures to exert control over several informal border crossings known as “trochas” (trails). Control over border crossings allowed the group to manage smuggling routes and generate revenue by charging migrants passage, a business that has sharply increased in 2020 with the COVID-19 pandemic.The CSF also exerted a high level of social control in its areas of operation. While it did not usurpe any local government functions, the group exercised significant control over the population, charging local businesses in exchange for “security” and imposing codes of conduct on some communities. Additionally, the CSF used graffiti to coerce voters in the days leading up to local and national protests, effectively suppressing protest turnout.","The CSF’s chain of command was blurred, owing to its hybrid civil, political, and armed character. The group took its political line from the government and local leaders of the ruling United Socialist Party of Venezuela (Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela – PSUV). It is unclear whether Bernal plays a direct leadership role in the CSF, but it is evident that they respond to his interests and strategies. InSight Crime investigations in Táchira report that mobilizing the group has been a part of his plans for the region, and there is evidence of close collusion between the CSF and the local security forces that Bernal commands in his role as protector. Furthermore, Bernal publicly met with and offered support to the region’s colectivos. William Gómez, mayor of Bolívar municipality and Jhon Carrillo, mayor of Pedro María Ureña, have been identified by locals as leaders of the CSF, and the group has been seen using mayors’ offices as operational hubs.Local operational leaders coordinatd actions on the ground. For instance, Oscar Rangel, alias “Cachú,” a grassroots activist linked to communist youth movements, coordinated the group’s operations in the municipality of Bolívar and reports to his political bosses. Rangel was shot dead in San Antonio del Táchira in May 2021, and it is believed the group disbanded soon after.When it was established, the group had approximately 150 members. However, according to field work conducted by InSight Crime in Táchira, the group experienced significant growth during 2019, as Nicólas Maduro’s government worked hard to establish greater control over criminal economies and armed actors along the Colombian border. But in 2021, local activists interviewed by InSight Crime confirmed the group had gone quiet and was probably no longer functioning.","The CSF’s criminal economies, political, and military presence was concentrated in San Antonio del Táchira, the main town on the border with Colombia. From 2018, the group took advantage of Colombian border closures and the COVID-19 pandemic to consolidate its control of criminal economies and expand its presence to other municipalities in the state of Táchira, including San Cristóbal, the state capital. Its presence was  identified in the area of the Tienditas international bridge, in the neighboring municipality of Pedro María Ureña, and the urban area of the Junín municipality.According to field interviews conducted by InSight Crime in San Antonio, emissaries of the CSF had a sporadic presence in the municipalities of Torbes and Cardenas. In northern Táchira, it operated from García de Hevia to the municipality of Panamericano.There were even reports of robberies by the CSF in the Colombian district of La Parada, close to Cúcuta. However, its main criminal economies was still limited to Venezuelan territory and there is no evidence that iit ever undertook systematic operations in Colombia.","The CSF collaborated with security forces to ensure control of Táchira. In May 2020, Bernal announced the deployment of 3,000 members of different Venezuelan security forces to the border between Colombia and Venezuela to control migratory flows. Evidence suggests that the CSF coordinated actions with the Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana – GNB) and the police special actions forces (Fuerzas de Acciones Especiales – FAES), whose current leader, Miguel Domínguez, was Bernal’s bodyguard and right-hand man for several years.The National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) a Colombian guerrilla group operating in Venezuela, was a strategic ally of the CSF and collaborated with the group to repress political protests and impose social control. According to local residents and officials consulted by InSight Crime in the Bolívar municipality, ELN members have participated in the distribution of CLAP food boxes and may have organized street cleaning days and deliveries of presents to children, alongside members of the CSF.There is even evidence of coordinated military action between state security forces, the ELN and the CSF. In mid-February 2020, Venezuelan security forces began a series of operations intended to expel Los Rastrojos, a Colombian criminal group, from the border area, especially from the Puerto Santander-Boca de Grita corridor. The ELN and colectivos led by Freddy Bernal participated in these operations, with the ELN providing the bulk of military force and the CSF providing local backup.","The Border Security Colectivo’s control along the Colombian border in Táchira has been driven by the Maduro regime’s increasing need for criminal revenues and border security. In the face of international pressure and diminished state coffers, these conditions look set to continue, making the CSF an important force in propping up the Maduro regime.The CSF’s control of informal border crossings allowed the government to control, and profit from, migration between Colombia and Venezuela, while the group’s capacity for repressing political dissent makes them a valuable political instrument.However, following the assassination of its leader and main contact with the government in May 2021, the CSF has essentially ceased to exist.",
Cartel of the Suns,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/cartel-de-los-soles-profile/,Cartel of the Suns,,./images/organizations/cartel-of-the-suns.jpg,2022-05-14,"['cartel of the suns', 'venezuela', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"The “Cartel of the Suns” (Cartel de los Soles) is the term used to describe drug trafficking cells embedded within the Venezuelan military.Despite the name, it is not a hierarchical group, but rather a network of  networks within the main branches of the military -- the army, navy, air force and National Guard, from the lowest to the highest levels – that are frequently protected by, coordinate with or in some cases are even directed by political actors.  These networks are highly fluid and in constant flux, with their composition dependent on the rotations of military personnel and political patronage.","In the 1990s, accusations emerged of National Guard troops collaborating with drug traffickers, primarily by accepting payments to look the other way while traffickers moved their wares.The term “Cartel of the Suns” was reportedly first used in 1993 when two National Guard generals, anti-drug chief Ramon Guillen Davila and his successor, Orlando Hernandez Villegas, were investigated for drug trafficking and other related crimes. As brigade commanders, each wore a single sun as insignia on their shoulders, giving rise to the name “Cartel of the Sun.” Later on, when allegations emerged that division commanders -- given double suns for their ranking -- were involved in the drug trade, the term evolved and became the “Cartel of the Suns.”During the early 2000s, political developments led to the deepening involvement of elements of the National Guard and other branches of the military in the drug trade.In Colombia, the President Álvaro Uribe, backed by billions of dollars of US military aid, launched an unprecedented military assault against the country’s leftist guerrilla groups, above all the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC), which pushed the guerrillas to shift more of their operations – including their growing cocaine trafficking operations - to Venezuela’s poorly policed border states. There, they built ever closer ties to the government of President Hugo Chávez, who saw the guerrillas not only as ideological allies but also a strategic bulwark against an increasingly hostile Colombia and its backer, the United States.In Venezuela, meanwhile, President Chávez was briefly ousted from power in a US-recognized attempted coup. In the aftermath, Chávez sought to shore up support with the military by filling many influential government positions or lucrative contract opportunities with army loyalists, and by turning a blind eye to the military’s growing corruption.With the military actively cooperating with the guerrillas in the border region, and with carte blanche to take part in criminal activities, the stage was set for it to get ever deeper into the drug trade.  Soon, cells in the security forces began to not only charge drug traffickers to allow them to move shipments but also to leverage their alliances with the guerrillas and other criminal actors to purchase, store, move and sell cocaine themselves.As the amount of cocaine flowing through Venezuela surged, evidence mounted that a growing number of senior members of the Chávez administration were also facilitating or even directly participating in drug trafficking.Some, such as intelligence officer Ramón Isidro Madriz Moreno and political leader Amilcar Jesús Figueroa Salazar, were sanctioned by US authorities as Cartel of the Suns members less for drug trafficking and more for their alleged collaboration with the FARC. Others, such as then intelligence chief Hugo “El Pollo” Carvajal, and former military General Cliver Antonio Alcalá Cordones, were accused of directly collaborating with Colombian and Venezuelan drug traffickers, not only by protecting their operations but also by investing in their own cocaine shipments and arranging trafficking operations.The accusations of official involvement in drug trafficking culminated in March 2020, when the US Justice Department indicted President Chávez’s successor Nicolás Maduro, former Vice President and the man widely considered to be the second most powerful man in the Chavismo movement, Diosdado Cabello, and several other current and former Venezuelan officials, as well as members of the now demobilized FARC’s leadership, on “narco-terrorism” charges.However, the indictment’s portrayal of the Cartel of the Suns as an organized drug cartel led by President Maduro and executing a strategy of “using cocaine as a weapon against America” bares little resemblance to how the Cartel of the Suns has evolved since the death of Hugo Chávez in 2013.Since Maduro took office, Venezuela has endured a series of economic, political, and social crises, which Maduro has had to manage without the loyalty inspired by Chávez, neither within the military nor within Chavismo. Against this backdrop, the Cartel of the Suns has evolved into a system of criminal patronage in which cocaine is used to help prop up the Maduro government.Today, the catch-all term “Cartel of the Suns” masks the fact that the state-drug trafficking axis is now less a network run by the military and Chavista politicians and more a system that it regulates. It is composed of a series of regional military-political-criminal nodes that are bound together by a national regime that guarantees impunity for its allies. Within this system, the regime rewards loyalty through assignment to regions known to offer a wealth of opportunities for enrichment through drug trafficking and other criminal economies.Drugs can now pass through the hands of several different trafficking nodes as they move through the country. The military plays different roles within these nodes in different regions, while local, rather than national, politicians directly or indirectly manage relations between the military and criminal groups and control the environment traffickers operate in.In each of these regions, those in charge of the state component of these trafficking nodes often change frequently, as military commanders are rotated through and political power is awarded and withdrawn. But the system continues regardless.The available evidence suggests that the Maduro regime maintains control of this system at the national level not by brokering cocaine deals, but by allocating and distributing concessions, choice appointments and assuring protection.","The Cartel of the Suns is a drug trafficking operation, although those that participate in it are often involved in other criminal economies such as fuel smuggling, illegal mining, black markets, and extortion.The military participates in drug trafficking in four key ways. The most common way is simply to take pay offs to turn a blind eye to or guarantee impunity for trafficking operations. This may come in the form of regular payments to ignore the operations of partner traffickers or through military cells creating free movement corridors for traffickers. These can be aerial, for example by turning off radars to allow drug flights to pass or providing special codes for the flight to be registered as legal, terrestrial, for example by facilitating passage through networks of checkpoints, or maritime, for example by halting patrols at certain times to allow drug boats to pass.In some cases, the military facilitates trafficking through its control of key infrastructure, above all shipping ports and airports. And in others, above all along internal movement corridors, military cells transport shipments themselves, often in official vehicles.Sometimes, these efforts are coordinated directly by organized trafficking cells under the command of military officers, in other cases, the participation is ad-hoc by low-ranking officials who are expected to kick up a share of their takings to the command.","Numerous senior members of the Chavista political movement have been accused of being leading members of the Cartel of the Suns and who continue to wield power today. Among them are President Maduro himself and Diosdado Cabello. While the evidence of Maduro directly participating in trafficking is scant, Cabello has faced the most persistent accusations of active involvement in the drug trade, accusations which are still common today.Others include former National Guard head and current Minister for Energy Néstor Reverol, former Vice President and current Minister of Industries and National Production Tareck El Aissami, current Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino, and former Caracas Mayor and current Governor of Táchira Freddy Bernal.However, within the Cartel of the Suns system active today it is unclear whether these actors directly participate in drug trafficking or, more likely, use their power to secure access to the cocaine trade for their political and military allies.A more active leadership role is instead likely played by state governors and local mayors in key trafficking zones, as well as the military commanders that rotate through regional postings in strategic territories.","The elements of the military most deeply involved in Venezuela’s drug trade are, unsurprisingly, concentrated along the western border with Colombia, especially the states of Apure, Zulia, Táchira, and Amazonas. Other key territories are the Caribbean coast, especially the state’s of Falcón, Sucre, Delta Amacuro, and Carabobo, which is home to Venezuela’s principal shipping port, Puerto Cabello. However, military involvement in cocaine trafficking along the multiple internal transit corridors that link the border to dispatch points is also common.","The past connections and trafficking relationships between the Cartel of the Suns and the FARC guerrillas has continued since the guerrillas’ 2017 demobilization through cooperation with some factions of the FARC dissidents groups, known collectively as the ex-FARC Mafia, above all the Acacio Medina Front, and the Second Marquetalia. However, the relationship with other factions, above all the 10th Front, have soured, and they and their drug trafficking operations have since been targeted extensively by the military.The guerrillas of the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberacíon Nacional – ELN) have also emerged as a key ally as they have taken advantage of the FARC demobilization to expand their presence in Venezuela and their participation in the drug trade in the region.Military and political actors involved in drug trafficking also maintain connections to a range of criminal groups and trafficking networks around the country as well as powerful narco-brokers such as Guajira Cartel chief Hermagoras González Polanco, alias “Gordito González.” However, these relations can change quickly and allies become enemies, such as in the case of the Paraguaná Cartel, which once enjoyed political protection and cooperated with elements of the military, but in recent years has been repeatedly targeted by security forces.","Although the United States has made efforts to bring the Cartel of the Suns activities to light in recent years, and has even sanctioned and charged some alleged members, the Venezuelan government has not pursued serious investigations or prosecutions of these suspects. In fact, it has in some cases promoted military officials accused of involvement in drug trafficking.Given this and Venezuela’s worsening political and economic crises, it seems likely that the operations of the Cartel of the Suns will continue largely unimpeded moving forward."
The Meleán,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/los-melean/,The Meleán,,./images/organizations/the-meleán.jpg,2021-01-08,['venezuela groups'],venezuela,"For decades, the Meleán crime family was one of the most powerful criminal groups in Venezuela. Established by Antonio Jesús Meleán Vergel, alias “Antonito,” the clan controlled large swathes of the northwestern state of Zulia from the 1980s to the early 2000s. Under Antonito’s command, the Meleán built a diverse criminal profile that included car theft, robberies, and extortion of Zulia’s major businesses.Following the murder of its patriarch in 2008, a new, more violent generation took over, and the group became embroiled in costly blood feuds. Over the years that followed, the group struggled to retain its position at the apex of an increasingly fragmented and chaotic underworld in Zulia, and much of the family left Venezuela. Today, the Meleán no longer exists as a criminal armed group, though some Meleán family members maintain criminal interests and sources in the region say they can still carry out operations through intact criminal networks.","The Meleán family was first linked to organized crime in 1976, when its dispute with another prominent rancher family – the Semprún Cedeños – turned violent, leaving at least 15 dead. the Meleán emerged victorious and began forging their criminal empire.Over the next two decades, Antonito propelled his family to the top of Zulia’s criminal underworld through extortion. Under his leadership, the Meleán began charging vacunas, or extortion “vaccines” paid by businesses for protection under threat of violence.As the criminal family grew into one of the most powerful armed groups in Zulia, it drew ever more attention, putting pressure on government forces to act. By the late 2000s, they could no longer ignore the Meleán, despite the gang infiltrating and buying off the police.In October 2008, the assassination of student leader Julio Soto drew widespread condemnation, and Maracaibo’s then-mayor accused the Meleán of carrying out the attack. He urged authorities to investigate Antonito, whom he publicly labeled a “mafioso” and accused of various crimes both within Zulia and beyond.But less than two months later, before authorities took any concrete action, Antonito was shot and killed outside a barber shop.Antonito’s murder was a devastating blow to the Meleán, especially as it appears to have been an inside job. Antonito’s bodyguard and close confidant, Daniel “Danielito” Leal Prieto, allegedly carried out the hit on the orders of Antonito’s business partner, José Luis Leal Rangel. Danielito was arrested and, though he reportedly sought protection from then-mayor of the municipality of San Francisco Omar Prieto, was murdered in his prison cell at El Marite Penitentiary Center.Though the Meleán survived Antonito’s death, they never fully recovered. After the attack, the gang fragmented, with those loyal to José Luis Leal Rangel forming their own group – the Leal – and starting a bloody rivalry.After Antonito’s death, his son Tirso Antonio Meleán, alias “Tirsito,” took over operations. Under Tirsito, the group became more violent and reckless, even using social media to publicize their assassinations.Tirsito’s reign coincided with a period of economic and social turmoil in Venezuela. The collapse of the oil industry drove up unemployment, transforming Zulia’s criminal landscape as gang recruitment surged and a more violent generation took the reins.As the situation in Zulia deteriorated, members of the Meleán family began moving abroad to Colombia and the United States. In 2018, Texas authorities arrested Tirsito for arms trafficking. In 2021, he was deported back to Venezuela after he had completed his sentence.With Tirsito in jail, his cousin, Bernardino Meleán Frontado, alias “Willy,” took over running the Meleán. His reign was short-lived, however, and Colombian authorities killed Willy in a shootout on November 7, 2020. The Meleán’s structure crumbled after Willy’s death, but many in Zulia believe the family retains criminal interests and can use connections with other groups to carry out operations, even though it no longer has centralized command over armed members nor control of territory.","Leadership of the Meléan has always been based on family ties. Antonio Jesús Meleán Vergel, alias “Antonito,” was the clan’s patriarch and led their rise as a criminal organization. He developed a reputation as a “gentleman mafioso” – one who demanded loyalty and silence from his organization’s members but also practiced restraint.Under his command, the Meleán only extorted the largest businesses and landowners. It also refrained from violence against civilians, especially women and children, who were considered untouchable under Antonito’s leadership. Moreover, Antonito served as a mediator between gangs, working to settle complaints and avoid violent clashes.After Antonito’s murder in 2008, his son, Tirsito, took over, ushering in a less restrained generation. Tirsito maintained control of the group until his 2018 arrest in the United States, leading to the brief reign of Willy Meléan, which was brought to a bloody end by Colombian police in 2020.Today, it is unclear who controls what remains of the Meleán family’s operations and interests. According to one former high-ranking security official with experience  confronting the group, who spoke to InSight Crime on condition of anonymity, Tirsito continues to coordinate the Meleán family’s operations from within prison.","It’s likely that the Meleán first started operating in Antonito’s home municipality of Santa Rita, in the Venezuelan state of Zulia. Publicly though, the gang became known while fighting for control of Colón Municipality, which lies on the other side of the state at the southern coast of Lake Maracaibo.As the family gained power, it spread throughout Zulia, establishing a presence in Cabimas, Maracaibo, Miranda, La Cañada de Urdaneta, and other municipalities.Under Willy’s leadership, the Meleán attempted to make inroads into Colombia. They carried out assassinations and tried to set up criminal operations in the departments of Cundinamarca, Magdalena, Guajira, and Santander, according to Venezuelan authorities and Colombian military intelligence documents cited in national news media.However, there is no evidence that the group is a significant player in these areas today, suggesting that they failed to put down roots in an already saturated criminal market.Today, the Meleán control no territory, but sources in Zulia say that the group benefits from continued influence within security forces and contracts local gangs to carry out operations.","The Meleán’s most infamous rivalry was with the splinter group the Leal – whose leadership orchestrated the death of Antonito before forming their own gang.Throughout the early 2010s, Zulia was marked by violent clashes between the two groups. In 2013, Zulian police told local news media that the Leal-Meleán rivalry was responsible for the majority of the state’s homicides. Since then, however, both groups have faded into the background.Today, one of the most powerful criminals with links to the Meleán is Erick Alberto Parra Mendoza, alias “Yeico Masacre,” who allegedly worked as a contract killer for Tirsito until the the Meleán leader’s arrest.But since then, the relationship seems to have soured, with Colombian news media reporting that Masacre tried and failed to take control of the gang in the wake of Tirsito’s arrest. In 2020, armed men claiming to be members of Yeico Masacre’s gang posted a video threatening Willy and anyone associated with him.","The Meleán family began losing much of its structure after Antonito’s death. Following the arrest or death of many of his descendants, the group has ceased operating as a traditional mafia.  Zulia, meanwhile, has changed dramatically since the peak of the Meleán’s power. The state’s criminal landscape is more violent, and the large, powerful, but orderly gangs of the past are gone, replaced by many small, chaotically violent groups competing for a share of the extortion market.As such, though the Meleán name continues to carry weight in Zulia, they are unlikely to make a full comeback in the state’s harsher criminal environment.",
Fuerza Anti-Unión,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/fuerza-anti-union/,Fuerza Anti-Unión,,./images/organizations/fuerza-anti-unión.jpg,2020-11-13,['mexico groups'],mexico,"La Fuerza Anti-Unión (FAU) is a criminal organization that has grown rapidly since its inception as a vigilante group. The FAU is known for its involvement in illicit economies across Mexico City and use of aggressive violence in an ongoing bloody turf war with its sworn rival, La Unión Tepito.Despite the capture of certain top leaders, the group is one of Mexico City’s largest criminal threats. The FAU appears set on expanding its presence in the nation’s capital through forging strategic alliances with other powerful criminal organizations.","The FAU’s emergence onto Mexico City’s criminal landscape has been suggested by two theories. One idea posits that the FAU came about as a vigilante group to violently combat La Unión Tepito’s extortion of business owners in Mexico City. Another suggests that when Roberto Moyado, alias “El Betito,” became La Unión Tepito’s leader, members of the organization splintered off to form the FAU, resulting in both groups contesting the control of microtrafficking and extortion territory in the city.The FAU’s bloody rivalry with La Unión Tepito is widely reported to have begun at the end of 2017, as both groups targeted each other with public acts of aggression. This has led to members from both sides being executed, with bodies typically being left for display on public highways.Since its inception, the FAU has grown rapidly, seeing through multiple attempts to expand its territory and involvement in Mexico City’s illicit economies for extortion and microtrafficking. Authorities have suggested that between 2017 and 2018 the group claimed fresh territory in its turf war with La Unión Tepito, including the municipalities of Álvaro Obregón, Tlalpan and Cuauhtémoc. In such zones, murders, violence and the presence of “narcomantas” — banners used by criminal groups to make announcements and threats — increased dramatically.During its period of expansion, the FAU’s ambition to control drug sales and extortion rackets in Mexico City’s Historic Center became clear. In 2018, it was reported that the FAU and La Unión Tepito had been contesting the bustling street of Manuel Peña and Peña in Cuauhtémoc, with both groups publicly killing rival gang members to gain control of lucrative criminal economies in the area.Correspondingly, the FAU’s growth has been consistently underscored by ongoing violence with its sworn rival.In June 2018, two dismembered bodies were discovered on Avenida Insurgentes, one of the most heavily traveled routes in Mexico City. A narcomanta was also found on the scene. The banner contained a message threatening El Tortas. The incident is reported to have been co-ordinated in Álvaro Obregón, where the FAU had been increasing its presence. Two days after the appearance of the banner, shootings and executions occurred at various points throughout the city, leaving at least seven dead.Approximately one month later, the FAU’s efforts to challenge La Unión Tepito for control of illicit economies in Mexico State became clear. In the space of a week, 12 people were murdered across Nezahualcóyotl, Ecatepec and Naucalpan, just outside of Mexico City. Authorities linked such homicides directly to the FAU and La Unión Tepito, claiming the FAU’s then-leader, Jorge Flores Concha, alias “El Tortas,” had sent members of the group to find and kill El Betito, in an effort to facilitate territorial expansion.The group’s involvement in such public acts of violence have also affected some of Mexico City’s most popular tourist zones. In September 2018, six people died in the capital’s Plaza Garibaldi, after two gunmen dressed as mariachis opened fire in another attempt to murder then-FAU leader, El Tortas. The hitmen were allegedly working on the orders of La Unión Tepito.Since El Tortas was captured in May 2019, the FAU has seen a spate of leadership changes, prompting media outlets and authorities alike to claim the group is weakening. High-ranking members of the organization have attempted to restructure operations.However, powerful figures in the group have continuously been arrested. Authorities detained seven presumed members of the organization in July 2020, in four separate raids across Azcapotzalco, Venustiano Carranza and Ecatepec. In each operation, cocaine was seized, along with a selection of firearms and other drugs, including marijuana and crystal methamphetamine. The FAU’s most recent leader, “El Lucas”, was captured in October 2020.The group has consistently allied itself with Mexico’s most powerful criminal organization, the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG), which is seeking to deepen its presence in the nation’s capital. The CJNG has reportedly been supplying the FAU with weapons, drugs and manpower.In October 2020, the strength and relevance of this alliance was showcased when a shoot-out in the district of Azcapotzalco left six dead and four wounded, with one of the arrested perpetrators telling police they were hired by the CJNG to attack drug dealers associated with La Unión Tepito.Recent investigations from authorities have suggested the FAU is currently operating in the municipalities of Azcapotzalco, Álvaro Obregón, Coyoacán, Cuauhtémoc, Iztacalco, Magdalena Contreras, Miguel Hidalgo and Venustiano Carranza.However, it appears as though neighborhoods in Cuauhtémoc and Venustiano Carranza are consistently contested by the FAU and La Unión Tepito. Recently, it was reported that in the first six months of 2020 over 60 people had died as a result of the ongoing turf war, with numerous homicides having occurred across Cuauhtémoc.","The FAU’s current leader is unknown. Since the capture of its high-profile founder, El Tortas, the group has seen frequent changes in who sits at the top of its organizational structure. This has reportedly led to internal divisions.The group’s most recent confirmed leader, El Lucas, was captured in October 2020. He was linked to the sale and distribution of drugs in the municipalities of Cuauhtémoc and Venustiano Carranza, killing members of rival groups and distributing arms to FAU members at two flower shops in Cuauhtémoc and robbery.","The FAU largely operates in Mexico City, although it reportedly has a presence in the nearby State of Mexico. In 2022, media reports noted its presence in Chalco, Valle de Chalco, Ixtapaluca and Nezahualcóyotl, according to ministerial sources in the state. Since its period of rapid expansion in 2018, the FAU has dealt in illicit economies across much of the capital.According to reports, El Tortas wanted to expand the group’s operations prior to his capture, with a focus on claiming cities across the State of Mexico, including Toluca and Ecatepec de Morelos. The leader also reportedly sought to seize a greater number of municipalities across Mexico’s capital, including Benito Juárez, Iztacalco and Iztapalapa, to name but a few.However, given the FAU’s ongoing volatile turf war with La Unión Tepito, it is difficult to say which municipalities in Mexico City the group truly dominates at any one time. For example, the FAU made temporary gains in Central de Abasto, the city’s largest marketplace where theft, trade in contraband and drug trafficking are commonplace. The group had been using underground tunnels to facilitate the work of approximately 50 members installed in the zone to control drug sales and extortion rackets. A site of this importance is unlikely to stay in a given group’s hands for long.However, media reports state that the gang it is currently active in Chalco, Valle de Chalco, Ixtapaluca and Nezahualcóyotl, according to ministerial sources in the State of Mexico.Mexico City’s tourist hotspot, Plaza Garibaldi, is another highly-disputed zone for the FAU. The local area hosts ample opportunities for microtrafficking and extortion rackets, meaning it is regularly contested between the FAU and La Unión Tepito. Ongoing battles between the two groups to control such zones have transformed the capital’s criminal landscape, despite persistent official denials that the city is largely free of cartels.While the FAU’s illicit activities are overwhelmingly concentrated in Mexico City, high-profile figures of the group have maintained crucial ties to other states.El Lucas was reported to have had bases in Morelos, Acapulco and Guerrero, where he evaded authorities, prior to his capture.Meanwhile, El Tortas frequently traveled to the states of Puebla, Tlaxcala and Morelos, where he allegedly presented himself as an operative of the CJNG.","The FAU was essentially born out of its rivalry with La Unión Tepito, the group’s long-term prime enemy.This enmity has been characterized by public killings, frequent shootings and subsequent displays of dismembered bodies, often with threatening messages attached. The FAU’s overarching aim when performing such acts of aggression has been to claim territory currently under La Unión Tepito’s control and essentially enhance its share in criminal economies for extortion and microtrafficking.The group’s activities have been bolstered by its strong alliance with the Jalisco Cartel New Generation, Mexico’s foremost criminal threat. This tie was reportedly formalized in a pact between El Tortas and CJNG leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias ""El Mencho"" in 2019. However, suspicions of links between the CJNG and La Fuerza Anti-Unión have existed since at least 2017, when the National Center for Planning, Analysis and Information for Combating Crime (Centro Nacional de Planeación, Análisis e Información para el Combate a la Delincuencia – Cenapi) first warned of it.The FAU’s alliance with the CJNG has endured multiple leadership changes. The group’s most recent head, El Lucas, reportedly had strong ties with CJNG operatives.The firm coalition is underscored by compatible criminal interests, mutually facilitating the CJNG’s ambition of deepening its presence in Mexico City and the FAU’s goal of reducing La Unión Tepito’s share in local illicit economies.The CJNG’s astronomic levels of power and influence on Mexico’s criminal landscape mean that it has the economic resources necessary to provide the FAU with weapons, drugs, vehicles and even hitmen, as both fight a united battle to take control of Mexico City’s trade in drugs and extortion rackets away from La Unión Tepito.An October 2020 raid at Mexico City’s Central de Abasto wholesale market found tunnels used to move drugs and weapons, which city officials said belonged to La Fuerza Anti-Unión, who had been supplied with weaponry by CJNG. In the same month, members of the CJNG reportedly hired hitmen to attack drug dealers associated with La Unión Tepito.The FAU has also benefited from ties to corrupt officials. It was reported that the group’s amicable relations with high-ranking members of Mexico City’s Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection (Secretaría de Seguridad Ciudadana – SSC) staved off the capture of El Tortas, as officials would pre-warn the leader of raids setting out to detain him.In February 2022, the FAU suffered a major blow. Jesús Olguín Rojas, alias ""El Churpias"", allegedly El Tortas' right-hand man, was arrested by authorities in Mexico City while carrying boxes of fentanyl and marijuana.","Authorities claim to have effectively disbanded the FAU, suggesting frequent captures of its leaders and alleged splintering have weakened the organization’s operational structure. The group has perhaps been less cohesive since El Tortas was detained.However, the FAU is highly unlikely to diminish its role as a critical player on Mexico City’s criminal landscape, particularly for as long as its strong alliance with the CJNG persists. This coalition provides the FAU with the resources and logistical support it needs to expand while deepening its influence in crucial zones of Mexico’s capital.On the contrary, displacing La Unión Tepito will not be a simple task for the group. To do so, the FAU and CJNG must break the very deep ties – even familial ones – that La Unión Tepito has in the center of Mexico City.",
La Unión Tepito,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/la-union-tepito-profile/,La Unión Tepito,,./images/organizations/la-unión-tepito.jpg,2022-05-09,"['la unión tepito', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"La Unión Tepito is a cell-based criminal organization in Mexico City, named after one of the capital’s largest neighborhoods. It is currently one of the city’s main criminal players, funding itself from microtrafficking, human trafficking and extortion.However, it has recently found its dominance seriously contested by both a targeted law enforcement crackdown and the incursion of larger Mexican cartels.","From the 1990s to the early 2010s, the leading gang in Mexico City was the Tepito Cartel, who rose to power using their ties to the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) and its chief enforcer Edgar Valdes Villareal, alias ""La Barbie."" The BLO’s decline in the late 2000s, however, led to a concurrent loss in status for the Tepito Cartel, inviting the arrival of competing groups, such as La Unión Tepito.Formed between 2009 and 2012 by defectors from declining groups such as the BLO and Familia Michoacána, possibly on the initiative of Valdes Villareal, La Unión Tepito quickly challenged the Tepito Cartel for control over both the Tepito neighborhood and large parts of Mexico City, using targeted acts of violence to assert its dominance and push out other groups, including cells of large national organizations like Los Zetas and the Sinaloa Cartel.In October 2012, six local drug retailers believed to have worked for the Sinaloa Cartel were executed in the street. In May 2013, 12 people were kidnapped from a bar in Mexico City’s Zona Rosa, including relatives of Tepito Cartel leaders. In both cases, La Unión Tepito was blamed. By the end of the ensuing gang war, La Unión Tepito was the predominant criminal force in Mexico City.Besides taking over drug retail spots across Mexico City, including Tepito itself, La Unión began extorting local businesses, often using the “gota a gota,” or “drop by drop,” method of offering high-interest loans to small business owners and street vendors with the threat of physical violence for those who could not pay.Taking over the center of the capital meant access to not just shops and street vendors, but also bars and nightclubs. Extorting these businesses was particularly profitable, allowing drug retailers to operate inside and forcibly recruit employees as dealers or lookouts. La Unión Tepito also developed ties to local police, granting the group a measure of impunity and forewarning with regard to law enforcement action.By 2017, however, another criminal entity would emerge named the Fuerza Anti-Unión, which would challenge La Unión’s dominance. Two theories exist about the Fuerza Anti-Unión: that they either arose as a vigilante group formed by business owners to combat La Unión’s extortion or as a splinter group from La Unión Tepito itself.The latter theory is held by Antonio Nieto, a Mexico City journalist and author of a book on La Unión Tepito, who says the Fuerza Anti-Unión were not created as a criminal group per se, but rather as a temporary hit squad founded by one capo of La Unión Tepito, alias “El Tortas,” to avenge his brother’s death at the hands of another capo, alias “El Betito.”However, most Mexican media framed the Fuerza Anti-Unión as a rival crime group, who reportedly established close relations with high-ranking members of Mexico City’s Secretariat of Security and Civilian Protection (Secretaría de Seguridad Ciudadana – SSC) while violently competing to control the city’s drug retail and extortion economies, particularly in the municipalities of Álvaro Obregón, Tlalpan and Cuauhtémoc.In June 2018, two dismembered bodies and a “narco-manta” (narco-banner) were found on Mexico City’s bustling Avenida Insurgentes, with a message from La Unión Tepito threatening the Fuerza Anti-Unión leader. It was only the most visible manifestation of a surge in violence that month, confirmed by Mexico City’s head of government José Ramón Amieva to be caused by clashes between the two groups.La Unión Tepito remained stronger than its rivals, however, expanding its extortion operations into wealthier parts of the city where it could demand higher amounts, sometimes up to 50,000 pesos a week (around $2,600). In April 2019, hundreds of local shopkeepers signed a letter pleading for Mexico City authorities to take action against La Unión, with the leader of the association warning shopkeepers might be forced to form a self-defense group if nothing was done. One week later, he was shot seven times by armed men and killed.In October 2019, a police raid captured 31 Unión members and uncovered two synthetic drug laboratories. The raid was triggered by reports of collusion between gang members and city authorities, according to Mexico City Security Secretary Omar García Harfuch, who claimed to have a list of around 120 police officers that may have collaborated with La Unión. Though 27 of those captured were later released, it did mark a turning point in La Unión’s fortunes.Since then, it has had to contend with the increased presence in Mexico City of the country’s two biggest crime groups, the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG) and, more recently and to a lesser extent, the Sinaloa Cartel (Cartel de Sinaloa).By 2020, the CJNG had come to supply microtraffickers with drugs in nine of Mexico City’s 16 districts, with CJNG members directly extorting businesses in the Historic Center, long a key Unión Tepito territory, and the new Fuerza Anti-Unión leader reportedly maintaining strong ties with the CJNG, including being supplied with drugs, arms and hitmen to wage its war against La Unión Tepito.Yet the CJNG’s Mexico City campaign appears to have slowed, with the cartel struggling to establish stable territorial control, and the Sinaloa Cartel appears to have limited itself to despatching envoys to the capital to try to increase its involvement in the lucrative drug consumption market.La Unión Tepito’s more pressing concern has therefore come from Mexico City law enforcement, who have deployed a relentless crackdown against it, freezing roughly $5.2 million across 1500 Unión Tepito-linked bank accounts and arresting some 550 of its members from January 2020 to April 2022, a greater number than those from the next ten local crime groups combined.As a result, in February 2022, Mexico City’s Secretary of Citizen Security Omar García Harfuch declared La Unión Tepito had been irreparably fragmented, claiming the group’s prioritized targeting and its leader’s arrest in early 2020 meant the gang’s remaining cells now operated in isolation, independently of central command.","As of May 2022, La Unión Tepito’s most commonly cited leader continues to be Rául Rojas Molina, alias “El Mi Jefe.”A key lieutenant of one of La Unión’s former leaders, Roberto Moyado Esparza (a.k.a.“El Betito”), who was arrested in 2018, Rojas Molina has climbed the ranks since his incarceration in 2010 for armed robbery and crimes against public health and is currently linked to 38 homicides, 18 of which he allegedly carried out.He has taken over since the May 2020 arrest of leader Brandon Alexis Flores, alias “El Junior,"" brother of Oscar Andrés, alias ""El Lunares,"" who was leader until his arrest in January 2020. Rojas Molina’s two closest subordinates are thought to be known as ""El Manzanas"" and ""El Elvis,"" respectively in charge of La Unión’s extortion and microtrafficking operations.However, as of 2022, the group’s continued targeting by law enforcement has meant La Unión Tepito is no longer a single hierarchical organization, but rather a series of connected cells, each with its own leader, territory and particular criminal activity. Media reports suggest there are now at least five major factions, with many more smaller cells.","La Unión Tepito is a highly localized criminal group, deriving its power from the social and even familial bonds it shares with certain Mexico City communities. Besides its heartland in the rough and central neighborhood of Tepito, it retains some sort of presence in all of Mexico City’s 16 districts, with a strong presence in the districts of Cuauhtémoc, Iztapalapa, Benito Juárez, Miguel Hidalgo and Venustiano Carranza, particularly in the Historic Centre and Zona Rosa.Outside of Mexico City, the group maintains lower-scale micro-trafficking and sometimes extortion operations in surrounding states, such as Hidalgo, Querétaro, Tlaxcala, Puebla, Veracruz and the State of Mexico.","Despite being initially formed by defectors of several crime groups, La Unión Tepito has many enemies and few allies. It has long fended off competition from the smaller Mexico City gangs, such as the Tláhuac Cartel, the Rodolfos and more recently Lenin Canchola, who seek to wrest away a larger share of the city’s microtrafficking and extortion economies.Then in 2020, reports suggested the CJNG was directly sending men to take over key Unión territory in Mexico City. According to Óscar Balderas, a Mexican journalist and expert in organized crime, ""the CJNG has an aggressive expansion plan that requires controlling the points that La Unión Tepito has today, such as the walking corridor behind the National Palace, the areas of La Merced, Mixcalco and Lagunilla.""The same year, drug tunnels were discovered under the Central de Abastos, Mexico’s largest market, allegedly operated by the Fuerza Anti-Unión with CJNG support. The former had reportedly installed 50 members in the market to control drug sales and extortion rackets, thereby challenging La Unión’s control of this important economic and criminal hub.Furthermore, the CJNG is reportedly arming not just the Fuerza Anti-Unión, but also some of the city’s gangs in their fight against La Unión Tepito, most notably the Tláhuac Cartel. There are also signs both main factions of the Sinaloa Cartel are making moves into the capital.","La Unión Tepito faces an uncertain future, one which has divided expert opinion. Some believe it will inevitably decline; others, that it will survive and evolve.Besides competition from local rivals and national cartels, the localized nature of the extortion and microtrafficking rents La Unión Tepito depends on makes it inherently vulnerable to the kind of atomization inflicted upon the group by law enforcement operations.On the other side, however, are those that argue that even if authorities were not overstating the crackdown’s impact on La Unión Tepito, its loss of centralized leadership is not an existential threat.For now, its dominant cells are not clashing with one another and can effectively repel the advance of local rivals, while neither the CJNG nor the Sinaloa Cartel have the firepower or inclination to take on the organization in a street-by-street shooting war across Mexico City.",
Rotela Clan,https://insightcrime.org/paraguay-organized-crime-news/rotela-clan/,Rotela Clan,,./images/organizations/rotela-clan.jpg,2020-08-23,"['clan rotela', 'paraguay groups']",paraguay,"Rotela Clan is a criminal group run by the Rotela family in Paraguay. It was originally specialized in the microtrafficking of crack in poorer neighborhoods of Asunción and Concepción, but has since expanded into a national organization, controlling much of the drug trafficking inside and outside prisons.","The origins of the clan date back to 2007, when Armando Javier Rotela and his brother, Óscar, began recruiting young people in Tobatí, near the capital, Asunción, to join their microtrafficking activities. The clan specialized in selling crack in poorer neighborhoods of Asunción, especially those along the Paraguay river.According to Blas Martínez, Paraguay's former national prisons director, the group rapidly also gained a foothold as drug traffickers inside prisons, especially the prison of Concepción.In 2014, Paraguay's National Anti-Drug Secretariat (Secretaría Nacional Antidrogas - SENAD) dismantled a crack production laboratory belonging to Rotela Clan in Asunción, finding almost five tons of the drug. The same operation found a booklet that detailed drug distribution points across the country, showing the national reach Armando Javier Rotela had achieved by then.By 2019, the group had consolidated itself as a national force. It was estimated that Armando Javier Rotela controlled half of the sales of all crack in the country.Currently, after focusing heavily on recruitment inside prisons, it is believed the gang could have over 1,000 members, largely outnumbering any other criminal group in Paraguay, including its main rivals, Brazil's First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC).However, one weakness is that its members' loyalty may not be particularly strong. According to Joaquín González, another former national director of prisons, most of their members are either temporary detainees, waiting to be charged, or are addicts themselves who exchange their loyalty in exchange for crack.This problem may be similar outside prison. In Asunción and Cordillera, much of Rotela Clan's membership is made up of microtraffickers and the group does not appear to have ambitions to expand into other criminal economies.","The Rotela Clan's leadership is hierarchical with the cousins, Armando Javier Rotela and Óscar Rotela Ayala, making most of the core decisions.In 2014, Óscar Rotela was arrested on charges of homicide and drug trafficking in San Lorenzo, a neighborhood of Asunción. His cousin and the clan's leader, Armando Javier Rotela, was first captured in 2011, during a police raid in the neighborhood of Bañado Sur in Asunción. But he escaped a year later from the prison of Misiones, alongside nine other members of the group.Rotela was recaptured in 2016 and jailed, but instead of becoming weakened, he reconverted the Rotela Clan to draw their power base from inside prisons and recruiting enough new members to consolidate a national presence.According to Antonio Bazán, the director of the prison in Concepción, told InSight Crime that Armando Javier Rotels has managed to maintain his leadership from inside prison due to always being highly respectful with guards and other prison staff. His recruitment strategy has also allegedly focused on those inmates coming from the worst socio-economic conditions.After the clashes with the PCC, Javier Rotela allegedly orchestrated a riot in the prison of Tacumbú against PCC members after the San Pedro prison in which 10 Rotela Clan members were murdered.In March 2020, almost four years after his arrest, Javier Rotela was condemned to 27 years in jail for criminal association and drug trafficking.","Historically, the Rotela Clan maintained its power base in the capital of Asunción, especially in the neighborhoods of Bañado Norte, Bañado Sur and Ricardo Brugada. It has now expanded into the departments of Cordillera, Central and Concepción.After the recapturing of Javier Rotela in 2016, the Rotela Clan began a rapid ascent to power within the country's prisons, authorities told InSight Crime. This has seen them consolidate a national presence, especially in Pedro Juan Cabellero and Misiones.But it was only after the massacre of 10 members of the Rotela Clan at the San Pedro prison in 2019 that the government really began to recognize the criminal group as a nationwide threat. “Before San Pedro, it was believed the clan was only in the prisons of Tacumbú, Antigua Emboscada and Misiones, but after that, we identified them in most of the most violent prisons in the country,"" Blas Martínez, Paraguay's former national director of prisons, told InSight Crime.In October 2019, prison officials stated that the Rotela Clan had expanded into at least 15 of Paraguay's 18 prisons.","While the Rotela Clan is not known to have any allies in particular, their status as a Paraguayan group has helped with the recruitment of members, especially in prisons.This has fueled their vicious feud with Brazil's PCC inside Paraguay's prisons. Once allies and even planning operations together, the two groups have become bitter rivals seeking to control drug trafficking inside and outside prisons. This has led to outbreaks of violence more often associated with the PCC's fights with rivals such as the Red Command (Comando Vermelho - CV) at home in Brazil.In June 2019, 10 members of the Rotela Clan were brutally murdered by the PCC in the prison of San Pedro, allegedly as retribution for a PCC member having been killed in Tacumbú prison and the reported perpetrator having been transferred to San Pedro.The two criminal groups have been at war since then.","Clashes between the Rotela Clan and the PCC have become a constant menace within Paraguay's overpopulated and corrupt prison system. After the massacre at San Pedro prison in August 2019, the government declared an emergency and sent in the army to take control of prisons.This additional layer of scrutiny could have hindered Rotela Clan operations but outbreaks of violence have continued. In January 2020, clashes with the PCC left at least one dead in the Misiones penitentiary.The balance of power between the Rotela Clan and the PCC will continue to play out, with uncertain results. On the one hand, the Rotela Clan is a homegrown Paraguayan criminal group, which has shown remarkable adaptability, surviving the capture of top personnel and expanding throughout the country's prison system.On the other hand, its enemy, the PCC is the dominant criminal group in Brazil, is a highly experienced prison gang and far outstrips their Paraguayan rivals in terms of overall manpower, financing and weaponry. For now, these resources are overwhelmingly concentrated in Brazil and the Rotela Clan has more men inside Paraguay, allowing it to hold firm.",
Second Marquetalia,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/segunda-marquetalia/,Second Marquetalia,,./images/organizations/second-marquetalia.jpg,2022-07-05,"['colombia groups', 'ex-farc mafia', 'segunda marquetalia']",colombia,"The Second Marquetalia is a group made up of former FARC guerrillas who refused to demobilize after the group’s peace agreement with the Colombian government in 2016.It is led by one of the most influential former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) leaders, Luciano Marín Arango, alias “Iván Márquez,” who took up arms again in 2019 after abandoning the peace process.The group operates mainly in mountainous regions along the Colombia-Venezuela border, seemingly with the tacit approval of the Venezuelan government, but it is unknown how many men it has at its disposal.The Second Marquetalia (Segunda Marquetalia) is in a curious position as its leaders are among the most well-known and sought-after criminal leaders in Colombia, but little is known about its size, geography or the criminal economies it is involved in.On May 18, 2021, one of the Second Marquetalia's most senior figures, Seuxis Pausías Hernández Solarte, alias “Jesús Santrich,” was killed in Venezuela. Following this, two more senior leaders, Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias “El Paisa,” and Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias “Romaña,” were killed in Venezuela, presumably in clashes with the 10th Front, also dissidents from the FARC. Márquez allegedly went to ground in December 2021, seeking to avoid a similar fate. He was not heard of until July 2022 when widespread rumors surfaced that he had been killed during an operation in Venezuela. Leadership of the group has now allegedly been taken over by veteran FARC commander, José Vicente Lesmes, alias ""Walter Mendoza.""","In August 2019, a number of former FARC commanders, led by Márquez, released a YouTube video announcing their return to arms and the creation of the Second Marquetalia, alleging that the Colombian government had betrayed the 2016 peace accords.Next to him appeared a number of well-known ex-FARC Mafia leaders, including “El Paisa,” “Jesús Santrich,” and “Romaña,” along with a number of commanders from various fronts and mobile columns.The group claimed to be continuing the FARC’s political struggles and stated they were the “heirs to the legacy of Manuel Marulanda Vélez,” the former leader of the demobilized guerrilla group.El Paisa abandoned the FARC training and reincorporation camp he had been based at in Miravalle, Caquetá, around April 2018 and appears to have headed for Venezuela. In August 2018, Márquez disappeared from the same camp after Santrich was arrested on drug trafficking charges, allegedly committed after the FARC demobilized.Romaña went missing in March 2019 after failing to appear at a mandated court appearance.As for Santrich, after his 2018 arrest for drug trafficking charges, he faced potential extradition to the United States. This extradition request was denied for a lack of evidence and he was freed in May 2019. He briefly took up a seat in congress that had been reserved for members of the FARC political party, but he fled shortly afterwards to Venezuela and joined up with his old comrades. He was killed in May 2021 in Venezuela.The further deaths of El Paisa and Romaña in December 2021, along with unconfirmed information that Márquez was on the run, appears to have left the group somewhat rudderless, although still able to muster up significant profits from its current territorial control of coca plantations and drug trafficking routes in Colombia and Venezuela. In July 2022, Colombian authorities were trying to confirm whether Márquez had also been killed in Venezuela. ","In the August 2019 video, Márquez and his commanders stated that their group would continue “collecting taxes that serve as financing for the rebellion ... and that are applied to the illegal economies and multinationals which loot our wealth.""The Second Marquetalia has maintained strong operations along the Colombia-Venezuela border, controlling much of the cocaine trafficking between the Colombian department of Arauca and the Venezuelan department of Apure. While it has sought to extend its influence into other parts of both countries, it has not succeeded to retrieve much of the criminal territory left behind by the FARC.","The main leader of the Second Marquetalia is Luciano Marín Arango, alias “Iván Márquez,” who was a member of the FARC Secretariat and the guerrilla group’s second-in-command at the time of its demobilization.A close ally of Márquez was Seuxis Pausías Hernández, alias “Jesús Santrich,” an ideologue who was key to the group’s public relations with other potential allies, before his death in May 2021.Other prominent leaders included Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias “El Paisa,” former commander of the FARC’s Teófilo Forero Mobile Column, and Henry Castellanos Garzón, alias “Romaña,” former leader of the FARC’s 53rd Front and who likely played a key part in the Second Marquetalia’s military strategy, until their deaths in December 2021.With the rumored death of Márquez in Venezuela in July 2022, command of the group may have passed to another veteran FARC commander, José Vicente Lesmes, alias ""Walter Mendoza.""","In the video announcing the creation of the Second Marquetalia, Márquez called on the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN) to “coordinate efforts” with the new group inside Colombia. In doing so, Márquez suggested reforming the defunct Simón Bolívar Guerrilla Coordinating Board (Coordinadora Guerrillera Simón Bolívar), a movement created in the 1980s and 1990s by the FARC, the ELN and the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación -- EPL) to carry out joint operations.The 18th Front of the ex-FARC Mafia has also recognized the leadership of Márquez. But to date, it is the only front made up of former FARC fighters to have sworn allegiance to Márquez.In 2018 and 2019, the group’s leaders met on two occasions with members of the ELN in the Venezuelan state of Apure, according to a number of media reports. The discussion reportedly revolved around the coordination of cocaine shipments between Colombia and Venezuela, especially in the Colombian department of Arauca, which the ELN has a strong presence in.Beyond these ties to the ELN, the Second Marquetalia has planned to unify ex-FARC Mafia groups, including those led by Miguel Botache Santillana, alias ""Gentil Duarte."" However, any such unification seems distant. Many of the fighters now under Gentil Duarte may not value Márquez’s legacy enough to follow him and may even view him harshly for participating in the peace process at all.This rivalry appears to have worsened in 2021 with the ex-FARC 10th Front reported to have clashed with Second Marquetalia forces in Apure, Venezuela, as well as perhaps having been involved in the death of Santrich, El Paisa and Romaña. ","The Second Marquetalia seems to be operating mostly along the border between Colombia and Venezuela, especially in the state of Apure in Venezuela and Colombia's Arauca department.With the adhesion of the ex-FARC Mafia’s 18th Front, Márquez's group has gained a presence in municipalities in the north of Antioquia, such as Ituango, and the southern part of Córdoba department. But for now, this appears to be the only satellite group that the Second Marquetalia has in other areas of Colombia.","Márquez appears to be trying to make the Second Marquetalia a unifying force for ex-FARC Mafia groups across Colombia, but he also needs to increase his number of fighters and criminal income to stay afloat.Since their high-profile announcement in August 2019, the leaders of the Second Marquetalia have remained largely underground. It appears most of their sway has been along sections of the Colombia-Venezuela border, especially in Apure and Arauca. In 2021, reports of sporadic clashes between Second Marquetalia fighters and members of other ex-FARC factions seemed to confirm this.It appears their best chance at reuniting the guerrillas who refused to demobilize would be to ally with Gentil Duarte, another former FARC commander who has been trying to bring disparate splinter groups together. But reports of clashes between the two groups appear to have ruled this out.In Venezuela, the group may have received help from the Venezuelan government after President Nicolás Maduro welcomed Márquez and Santrich to come to the country in 2019. Like the ELN, the Second Marquetalia is likely using Venezuelan territory as an operating base safe from reprisals from Colombian armed forces.The killing of Jesús Santrich inside Venezuela in May 2021, however, seems to indicate a change of fortunes for the group. The death of one of their most prominent leaders in uncertain circumstances suggests Venezuela is no longer the safe haven it once was.The group has been left further weakened following a series of bitter setbacks against the 10th Front in Venezuela in late 2021 and early 2022. While it still controls enviable criminal real estate and drug trafficking routes, it may no longer have a chance of accomplishing its original goal: unifying the ex-FARC. Should it be confirmed that Iván Márquez has also been killed, then the group may rapidly fragment into disparate, smaller criminal gangs with little to no connections to the FARC's former political ideology. "
Chapitos,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/los-chapitos/,Chapitos,,./images/organizations/chapitos.jpg,2022-01-09,"['el chapo', 'mexico', 'mexico groups', 'mexico personalities', 'sinaloa cartel', 'us/mexico border']",us/mexico,"The now-jailed former Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo,” reportedly had many children but only a select few of them, known collectively as the Chapitos, are at the center of an ongoing internal feud for control of the group’s operations against the last remaining member of the so-called “old guard,” Ismael Zambada García, alias “El Mayo.”While neither side has yet to exert the type of dominance that would make clear who is really in charge of the group’s criminal activities, there’s been no shortage of blood spilled as the two internal factions battle it out.In 2021 and 2022, the Chapitos continued to gain in strength becoming among the main producers and traffickers of fentanyl and methamphetamine to the United States. They expanded their territorial control in Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Sonora, and Baja California, and reinforced their earnings by profiting from illegal mining, fishing, migrant smuggling and more. They were named InSight Crime's Criminal Winners for 2022.They suffered a blow, however, when Ovidio Guzmán López was arrested for the second time in Sinaloa on January 5, 2023, leading to a major outbreak of violence in which more than two dozen people were killed. ","While El Chapo is said to have dozens of children, four of them have figured prominently into the Sinaloa Cartel’s criminal operations: Joaquín Guzmán López, Ovidio Guzmán López, Iván Archivaldo Guzmán Salazar, and Jesús Alfredo Guzmán Salazar.Ovidio, Iván, and Jesús Alfredo were apparently brought into the Sinaloa Cartel’s criminal operations at a young age as teenagers by their father and El Mayo in order to learn the ins and outs of the organization. Ovidio, who was sanctioned by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) in 2012 and indicted in February 2019, has garnered the most attention in recent years.In October 2019, Mexican security forces launched a poorly planned operation to capture Ovidio in the Sinaloa state capital of Culiacán. Shortly after word of Ovidio’s detention spread, Sinaloa Cartel members responded in force, swarming the city and launching an all-out offensive to demand his release. President Andrés Manuel López Obrador ultimately “ordered that the operation be stopped and that the presumed criminal be set free.”According to the US Treasury Department, Ovidio is said to be a “key lieutenant” within the Sinaloa Cartel’s ranks.For their part, Iván and Jésus are also thought to be important cartel operatives. In 2016, the two brothers were among a group of men abducted by the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación - CJNG) from a restaurant in an upscale district of the Mexican tourism center, Puerto Vallarta, in Jalisco state, the CJNG’s home turf. Both sons were later released.However, Jésus seems to have taken on an increasingly prominent role in the Sinaloa Cartel’s business. In fact, he has landed himself on the US Drug Enforcement Administration’s (DEA) most wanted list, the only son to earn that distinction. In 2015, US prosecutors also indicted him alongside his father and a number of other cartel leaders on drug trafficking charges. Jésus is also believed to play an important international role for the group. In 2016, he allegedly spent a few months in the Colombian city of Medellín under the protection of La Terraza, one of the sprawling city’s most powerful criminal gangs. Not much is known about Joaquín, who has kept a relatively low profile in comparison to his other brothers. That said, in February 2019, the US Justice Department indicted him alongside Ovidio for conspiring to traffic cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana into the United States. The indictment itself lacked detailed specifics but US prosecutors allege the trafficking took place over the course of a decade between April 2008 and April 2018 for the Sinaloa Cartel.In their father’s absence following his final 2016 arrest and subsequent extradition, the Chapitos have been at odds with El Mayo, as well as their uncle, Aureliano Guzmán Loera, alias “El Guano,” over control of the group’s operations.Given that their father founded the group, the sons seem to have felt entitled to inherit what their father created. While indeed much flashier with spending drug proceeds and partying than El Mayo, the Chapitos do know the inner workings of the cartel and are looking to assume supreme control.As a result, fierce battles between the two sides have continued for years. Most recently, in May 2020, José Rodrigo Aréchiga Gamboa, alias “El Chino Antrax” -- once the head of the Sinaloa Cartel’s Antrax hit squad and an associate of El Mayo -- was found dead after escaping federal probation supervision in San Diego. The Chapitos are believed to be behind the slaying.El Chino Antrax was a close associate of El Mayo, growing up with the Zambada family and alongside El Mayo’s sons in Culiacán. This long history makes it unlikely that the aging capo would have had much to gain from killing a long-time ally at a time when he could have needed him as internal tensions remain high.In June 2020, a multi-hour shootout reportedly between the two sides outside Culiacán left 16 dead.While the Chapitos have kept the heat up, US authorities have taken note. At the end of 2021, the US State Department announced that, in addition to facing federal drug trafficking charges, the government had upped its reward to $20 million for information that would help them in capturing the four sons. The US Treasury Department has also sanctioned the Chapitos under the so-called Kingpin Act.Despite being in the crosshairs of US authorities, the Chapitos have only stepped up their efforts to exert dominance over the group their father once led. In February 2022, armed men - reportedly loyal to the Chapitos - riding in a convoy of dozens of vehicles laid siege on the municipality of Caborca near the US-Mexico border. For hours, the convoy occupied the city as local police were unable to repel them until morning. In the end, the attack left two dead and at least five others kidnapped.With the help of the Salazar, a local group aligned with the Sinaloa Cartel for years, the Chapitos have sought to secure control of a key drug trafficking corridor stretching from their home base in Sinaloa, through Sonora and Baja California, and over the US-Mexico border.Increased firepower may be helping their bid. In early March, the Mexican Army and National Guard raided four houses in Navojoa municipality in the south of Sonora state, seizing an arsenal of almost three million rounds of ammunition of varying calibers, six .50 caliber rifles, more than 150 handguns and automatic rifles, dozens of grenades and 12 bulletproof vests, among other drugs, magazines and tactical gear. This was one of the largest criminal arsenals ever seized in Mexico.After their notoriety rose significantly through 2021 and 2022, the Chapitos suffered a blow on January 5, 2023, when Ovidio was arrested in Culiacan, the state capital of Sinaloa. According to Mexican Defense Minister Luis Crescencio Sandoval, an Army patrol came upon a convoy of six armored trucks. The occupants refused to cooperate with a check of the vehicles and opened fire on security forces. A large number of alleged Sinaloa Cartel members were arrested after the shootout, including Ovidio. At least seven soldiers were killed in this initial exchange of fire.Following his arrest, much like in 2019, blockades were set up across the city and other parts of Sinaloa, with cartel gunmen taking shots at police and army troops and even bringing down a military helicopter. Within hours, President López Obrador sent in reinforcements to calm the situation. As of January 9, at least 29 people had been killed following Ovidio's arrest, including ten Mexican soldiers.While Ovidio was not released this time, this action proved the rapid mobilization and response capacity of the Sinaloa Cartel on their own turf.","The Chapitos’ main business, much like their father before them, is international drug trafficking. According to various US indictments, the sons are involved in trafficking large quantities of everything from cocaine and marijuana to methamphetamine into the United States using their vast web of contacts throughout Latin America.In particular, the group has adjusted to shifting drug markets and become ever more involved in the synthetic drug trade alongside the CJNG, especially with regards to trafficking the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl. In fact, the Chapitos have expanded their activities to include the exploitation of drug rehab centers to recruit new traffickers – yet another source of continued violence with El Mayo.In addition, the group has also looked beyond the US market and started tapping into lucrative markets in Australia.Today, the Chapitos are among the main suppliers of fentanyl and methamphetamine into the United States. The US Justice Department issued charges against them for conspiracy to distribute cocaine, methamphetamine, and marijuana in 2021 and rewards of $5 million have been announced for each of them.","The primary stomping grounds for the Chapitos are in their birthplace of Sinaloa state, the group's fiefdom in northwest Mexico along the country’s Pacific coast, especially in the capital city of Culiacán. However, El Chapo’s sons seem to have much more sway and strength within Culiacán and other urban centers. On the other hand, El Mayo is believed to maintain a strong hold on his rural networks in the areas surrounding the capital city, which the Chapitos haven’t yet been able to seize control of.As a whole, the Sinaloa Cartel is operational in major cities stretching from New York City to Buenos Aires and countless others in between. The group also operates in at least 17 Mexican states, and by some estimates, in as many as 50 countries.More recently, the feud between the Chapitos and El Mayo has spread beyond its longtime center in Sinaloa to reach the states of Baja California and Sonora.And in September 2021, reports surfaced that representatives of the Chapitos were regularly travelling to Mexico City to seek to extend their influence there. In early 2021, Mexican authorities took down the Sinaloas, a cell of the Sinaloa Cartel reportedly under the influence of the Chapitos operating in the nearby State of Mexico. But this has not stopped the Chapitos from continuing to expand into the capital, especially in the microtrafficking scene of Tepito and Tlalpan.In 2022, they also intensified a long-running battle against the Caborca Cartel in Sonora, following the arrest of that rival group's founder, Rafael Caro Quintero.","At the present moment, their father’s former right-hand man, El Mayo, appears to be internal enemy number one for the Chapitos. In addition, there have been reported family frictions with their uncle, El Guano, over control of drug trafficking territory and alleged extortion payments he was thought to be charging in parts of Sinaloa.In addition, the Chapitos have battled the Beltrán Leyva Organization, the Sinaloa Cartel’s one-time ally before a 2008 split kicked off a bloody battle between the two groups. In 2016, more than 100 Beltrán Leyva members were reportedly responsible for looting El Chapo’s mother’s home in the mountains of Sinaloa, forcing her and hundreds of others from nearby communities to flee the area.To help in their ongoing turf wars, the Chapitos have recruited allies across several states. This list includes former rivals such as Pablo Edwin Huerta Nuno, alias “El Flaquito,” formerly of the Arellano Felix Cartel in Baja California, as well as longtime associates such as Néstor Ernesto Pérez Salas, alias “has also sanctioned,” in Culiacán.Some experts have also suggested that the CJNG has benefited from the ongoing feud between Los Chapitos and El Mayo, in turn strengthened their power and control over parts of Mexico.But the CJNG remain a top enemy of the Chapitos as they and the Sinaloa Cartel battle for ultimate control over Mexico’s vast criminal economies. CJNG leader Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, alias “El Mencho,” even allegedly assembled a hit squad to hunt down and kill El Chapo’s sons.
","Looking ahead, the Chapitos certainly have a leg up on El Mayo as far as longevity goes. The old capo is reportedly in bad health and battling diabetes. However, El Mayo’s roots in the Sinaloa Cartel run deep. The fact that the Chapitos have been unsuccessful in seizing total control of the group’s operations thus far suggests that El Mayo still has plenty of fight left in him.However, their grip is slowly tightening. The expansion of their territory to Sonora, Baja California and Chihuahua has given them a major advantage along the US border. Their specialization in synthetic drug trafficking, alongside marijuana and cocaine, provides an ever-steady supply of cash. And their reputation, through the Chapiza movement, continues to grow.The arrest of Ovidio in January 2023, however, poses a major question. Will the group stay united, or will fractures begin to emerge?",
Tren de Aragua,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/tren-de-aragua/,Tren de Aragua,,./images/organizations/tren-de-aragua.jpg,2021-10-21,"['tren de aragua', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"The Tren de Aragua is Venezuela’s most powerful, homegrown criminal actor. Its headquarters are in the Tocorón prison in Aragua state and involved in everything from extorsion to kidnappings, homicide, vehicle theft, drug trafficking, arms trafficking, human trafficking and contraband.It expanded rapidly in 2020 and 2021, setting up a major presence along the border trails separating Colombia and Venezuela, as well as along the border with Brazil. It has also has been involved in smuggling Venezuelan migrants in other parts of the region, including Ecuador, Peru, Chile and Bolivia.The gang was named InSight Crime's ""Criminal Winner"" in 2020 for being the first homegrown Venezuelan criminal actor to expand rapidly into other countries.","The Tren de Aragua’s origins date back to the 2000s when, during construction on Venezuela’s railway system, a workers’ union saw an opportunity to enter the criminal world. The first members of the group began by demanding bribes in order to give people certain job posts but they soon turned to extortion, kidnap and robbery.The rise of Tren de Aragua seems to be connected with the career of one of the highest-ranking officials in Venezuela, Tareck El Aissami. During his time as interior and justice minister between 2008 and 2012, prison gangs saw a rapid development, including Tren de Aragua. And police sources consulted by InSight Crime said that Tren de Aragua fortified its operations after El Aissami became governor of Aragua in 2012. During his time as governor, between 2012 and 2017, Aragua had the highest number of homicides in the country.Since then, Tren de Aragua has maintained close connections to its home state but has ambitiously expanded. In July 2019, reports began to emerge of the gang moving into border areas with Colombia. Freddy Bernal, a high-ranking member of the Venezuelan regime, reported the presence of Tren de Aragua members moving marijuana from the state of Táchira to the central state of Barinas.Also in July 2019, eight members were arrested in the border town of Cúcuta. Colombia's non-governmental Peace and Reconciliation Foundation (Fundación Paz y Reconciliación - PARES) reported that the migration had been achieved with the support of Los Urabeños, one of Colombia’s most powerful and extensive criminal networks.Since then, Tren de Aragua has grown in strength at the Colombian border, clashing with state forces and with the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) and FARC dissidents in the Venezuelan state of Arauca and Colombian department of Apure in 2020 and 2021.Brazilian security forces reported in September 2019 that Tren de Aragua cells were operating in Pacaraima, in northern Brazil, and that captured members of the gang were starting to sow cells inside the Brazilian prison system. Brazilian media noted the gang had gained a foothold in the country through human smuggling and extorting Venezuelan migrants on the border.In November 2020, Ecuadorean police announced that they had dismantled a cell of the group in Tulcán on the Colombia-Ecuador border. The group was involved in extorting the local transport system and smuggling migrants from Colombia into Ecuador, en route to Peru. In Peru itself, another member of Tren de Aragua was arrested, adding to evidence that splinter cells have taken root in the country.In October 2021, Chilean investigators launched a raft of inquiries into a number of Tren de Aragua members, helping Venezuelan migrants illegally cross from Bolivia.","The leader of the Tren de Aragua is Héctor Rusthenford Guerrero Flores, alias “Niño Guerrero."" He is based in the Tocorón prison from where he oversees the gang and the Fundación Somos El Barrio JK, an institution which the group registered in order to secure state resources and support. After being jailed for the murder of a police officer in 2005, he came to notoriety after breaking out from Tocorón in 2012. It is unknown exactly how or when he took over the leadership of Tren de Aragua but he has led the group since at least 2015. In total, the Tren de Aragua has more than 2,700 members, including both armed criminals and others who gather ""intelligence"" for the group. While the group is a national force across Venezuela, it has consolidated its power in Aragua where, as it ranks swelled, those of the state police dwindled.Little is currently known about how its operations are managed outside Venezuela. Small bands of members, affiliated to Tren de Aragua, have been actively involved in smuggling migrants across a number of borders in the region but more information is needed on how these actions are coordinated with leadership in Aragua, especially in Tocorón prison","The Tren de Aragua’s base of operations is in Aragua state, within which the group has two principal enclaves: the Tocorón prison and the community of San Vicente in the southeastern municipality of Giradot. This sector has more than 20 neighborhoods and functions as a sort of “peace zone,” where police forces are largely barred from entering. The Fundación Somos El Barrio JK is based in San Vicente.Police sources and residents of San Vicente confirmed to InSight Crime that the letters of the Fundación Somos El Barrio JK represent the initials of the organization’s principal leader, named Kleiverson, alias “Flipper,” as well as his wife, Jennifer De Sousa, known as “Catira.”Despite Tocorón already facing huge overcrowding, Tren de Aragua’s earnings and power have been boosted during 2020 by transfers of inmates from other prisons. Meanwhile, the gang has clamped down on the population of San Vicente, imposing curfews and patrolling openly with heavy weaponry, according to police statements and video seen by InSight Crime. Sources in the Aragua police claim the gang has taken over gas stations in Aragua, increasing gasoline costs significantly at a time when fuel is in severe shortage.
The Tren de Aragua is present in at least seven states of Venezuela. In addition to Aragua, the group has managed to also consolidate its presence in the states of Carabobo, Sucre, Bolívar, Guárico, Trujillo and Miranda.In order to expand, the gang has frequently established alliances with criminal actors in other states, as well as sending some its members across the country to set up new criminal revenue streams. For example, in the eastern state of Bolívar, two Tren de Aragua members, Larry Amaury Álvarez, alias “Larry Changa,” and Johan Petrica, set up a lucrative operation which controls part of the gold mines in the state. From here, the gang moves illegally mined gold and coltan to Brazil. In the state of Sucre, the Tren de Aragua moves drugs and contraband such as copper to Trinidad and Tobago.Police sources confirmed to InSight Crime that Niño Guerrero also directly controls the extortion of local shopkeepers and agricultural workers in the state of Guárico, which neighbors Aragua. Venezuelan security forces have warned of the Tren de Aragua’s presence in Táchira state, which shares a border with Colombia. InSight Crime field investigations in this region have confirmed that Tren de Aragua members are not permanently based in Táchira but travel through the state to reach Colombia.The state of Lara saw the explosion onto the criminal scene of José Santana, alias “Santanita,” a previously little-known gang leader whom Venezuelan authorities believe is operating under orders from Guerrero. Violently extorting car dealerships, using grenades to destroy businesses who do not comply and circulating threats via social media, Santanita’s gang has been a priority target for Venezuelan authorities throughout 2020, but he has also eluded capture so far. Similarly, the northwest state of Zulia has seen the sudden resurgence of Tren del Norte, a prison gang whose leader was imprisoned in Tocorón until 2017 and reportedly grew close to Guerrero. After several years of decline, the gang was linked to a wave of grenade attacks in the state capital Maracaibo during late 2019 and into 2020, raising speculation the gang had secured more powerful backing.In 2020 and 2021, the gang has rapidly expanded to become a transnational criminal threat. Much of this expansion has followed the flow of Venezuelan migrants into neighboring countries and Tren de Aragua members have been involved in migrant smuggling in Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile. It has also set up a permanent, strong presence in the remote border trails along the Colombia-Venezuela border, where it has clashed with the ELN for control of cross-border economies, such as human smuggling and contraband.","The Tren de Aragua has links with other megabandas and organized crime groups that operate in other regions, and seems to be skilled at making alliances with authorities. But in late 2019 and early 2020, Venezuelan security force units, such as the Special Action Forces (Fuerzas de Acciones Especiales -- FAES), carried out more operations against the group, detaining and even killing its members. In Aragua state, a criminal group known as “Los Carajitos Locos del 19,” largely comprised of younger individuals, has tried to push the Tren de Aragua out of the state. However, a number of the group’s members have been killed in confrontations with Tren de Aragua members.In the state of Carabobo, one of the group’s allies is Néstor Richardi, the gang leader in Tocuyito prison. In addition to being implicated in extortion activities, he has even tried replicating many of the criminal economies the Tren de Aragua are involved in.In Guárico state, two of the Tren de Aragua’s main allies are the Tren del Llano megabanda, led by Gilberto Malony Hernández, alias “Malony,” and another megabanda led by Manuel Alejandro Moyetones, also known as “Mandarria.” According to reviews of police and media information, Mandarria may actually be in Peru.The Tren de Aragua also has an alliance with a megabanda, known as the Tren del Norte. This gang is headed by Edwin Ramón Soto Nava, alias “Mocho” Edwin, who was previously jailed in Tocorón prison, where he met Niño Guerrero.
According to a source within Venezuela’s criminal investigation unit (Cuerpo de Investigaciones Científicas, Penales y Criminalísticas – CICPC), Niño Guerrero also has links with state security forces. “He meets with certain security force officials and shares information he has on gangs, not to dismantle them, but rather in exchange for money or to gain control over the territories dominated by these other criminal organizations,"" the source told InSight Crime.But while there is no evidence to confirm the Tren de Aragua’s links to state officials, Prison Minister Iris Varela has made public visits to the San Vicente community to meet with the Fundación Somos El Barrio JK.In 2020 and 2021, Tren de Aragua has made new and more powerful enemies. It has become a new faction contesting the border trails between Venezuela and Colombia from the ELN and the ex-FARC Mafia. The fact it can stand up to these more powerful and more experience guerrillas is a testimony of its newfound strength.","The territorial expansion of the Tren de Aragua is ongoing. This has made it not just a significant domestic threat to security in Venezuela but it has made incursions into the neighboring countries of Colombia, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Chile.While it is the first Venezuelan megabanda to expand on such a scale, Venezuelan security experts have told InSight Crime that it has achieved its success in thanks to support from the Venezuelan government, which has not acted in any concerted way to curb the group's expansion.The gang's expansion is a first for Venezuelan organized crime and, as it continues to grow, it may become one of Latin America's foremost criminal threats.",
Family of the North - FDN,https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/family-of-the-north-fdn/,Family of the North - FDN,,./images/organizations/family-of-the-north---fdn.jpg,2020-03-05,"['brazil', 'brazil groups']",brazil,"The Family of the North has long been Brazil’s third-largest criminal group, with a strong presence in northern Brazil but not matching the nationwide presence of the First Capital Command and Red Command.The Family of the North (Familia do Norte - FDN) was created between 2006 and 2007, by its two founders, José Roberto Fernandes Barbosa, alias “Zé Roberto da Compensa” and Gelson Carnaúba, alias “Mano G.” In addition to quickly dominating drug trafficking and other criminal economies in the northwestern state of Amazonas, the FDN sought to contain the advances of the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC) along the Solimões River, an important drug trafficking route as it connects the triple border of Brazil, Colombia and Peru, to the Atlantic Ocean. While the FDN has remained firmly headquartered in Amazonas, it has had connections to other Brazilian states and even Venezuela, as well as forging alliances with other criminal gangs in Brazil.In early 2020, the FDN came under sustained attack by the Red Command (Comando Vermelho – CV) in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas, and while the fallout of this war has not been fully measured, it is likely the FDN has been left greatly weakened.","The FDN was established in 2006 and 2007 and, like the PCC and the CV, the group was orchestrated by its two supreme leaders, mentioned above, from within the Brazilian prison system. However, the idea was only put into practice when they got out of prison.The FDN has sought to recruit members by fighting back against dangerous or unhealthy conditions inside prisons, extending a helping hand in exchange for membership. Inspired by the PCC and CV, the criminal group maintains a strict identification register of its members, assigning them each a registration number. The FDN is also subject to a set of rules, known as “Doctrines of the Family” (Doutrinas da Familia), which is overseen by a Council, once made up of its two founders and other senior members.This foundation allowed the group to rapidly spread inside and outside the prisons of northern Brazil and to become the country’s third-largest criminal group, albeit without a nationwide foothold. The Attorney General’s Office stated in 2015, after Operation La Muralla, that the FDN was taking on dimensions similar to the PCC and CV, based on its leadership structure, internal set of rules, range of criminal economies, and local, national and international connections.In order to prevent the spread of the PCC in the North, especially Amazonas, the FDN and CV forged an alliance in 2015. This lasted three years before breaking down and in 2018, FDN founder Gelson Carnaúba changed sides and joined the CV.The group had already a scission in 2017 when a senior member, João Pinto Carioca, alias “João Branco,” founded a splinter group, the “Pure Family of the North” (Familia do Norte Pura) and the two factions have waged bloody campaigns of violence against each other since then. Particularly violent prison riots between the two groups led to the deaths of 55 inmates between May 26 and 27, 2019.","At the start, the main FDN leaders were Zé Roberto da Compensa and Gelson Carnaúba, followed by the likes of alias Roque, Copinho, Nanico and João Branco. In addition to these leaders, the FDN Council was made up of 13 members, all with full knowledge of the organization’s operations. However, this leadership was broken up after Carnaúba and  João Branco left the group.Videos by FDN members in response to the CV attacks in January 2020 show that what remains of the group is firmly under the command of Zé Roberto da Compensa, with his son, Luciano da Silva Barbosa, alias “L7,” emerging as another leader.","The FDN was established mainly in the state of Amazonas, operating within and outside the prison system. The group focuses its main actions on maintaining control of drug trafficking along the Solimões River, which links Brazil’s border with Colombia and Peru to Manaus, its largest northern city, and the Atlantic Ocean.While the PCC and CV have maintained operations in the state of Amazonas, the FDN remained strongly present in most cities, municipalities and the border region. It is likely, however, that its geographical reach will have been severely affected by recent attacks against it by the CV and due to internal infighting.","Initially, the FDN sought an alliance with the Red Command to contain the advance of the PCC in Amazonas. However, the FDN-CV alliance, which lasted from 2015 to 2018, was broken after a disagreement occurred within the FDN itself, involving Gelson Carnaúba and Zé da Compensa.Since the breakdown of this alliance, the dispute for dominance of illicit routes in Amazonas, especially the Solimões River, has been bitterly contested between all three criminal factions. This has led to frequent riots in Amazonas prisons, in which hundreds of prisoners have been brutally murdered.An investigation carried out by Brazil’s Attorney General’s Office and federal police also found that the FDN had maintained contacts with Nelson Flores Collantes, a known supplier of drugs and weapons for the now-demobilized Revolutionary Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). Equally, there is evidence that the FDN has developed a relationship with criminal gangs in Colombia, including Oficina de Envigado and Los Caqueteños, allowing these groups to jointly exploit cross-border drug trafficking by land and river in the state of Amazonas.","The outlook for FDN is bleak, particularly after CV was able to take over the capital of Amazonas, Manaus, with relative ease. At stake is who will control the flow of narcotics that reaches the state of Amazonas from Colombia and Peru, by land and river. This might also lead to the FDN to lose control of its prized Solimões River, along which it sends cocaine to be distributed in Brazil and beyond.The departures of João Branco and Gelson Carnaúba were severe blows, especially with the latter now seemingly heavily involved in the CV’s attempts to take Manaus.",
Ex-FARC Mafia,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/ex-farc-mafia/,Ex-FARC Mafia,,./images/organizations/ex-farc-mafia.jpg,2022-10-20,"['colombia groups', 'ex-farc mafia', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"The ex-FARC mafia are a series of criminal structures that emerged during the peace negotiations between the Colombian government and the FARC guerrilla, specifically after signing the peace agreement in 2016.The ex-FARC mafia consists of groups that do not necessarily have a relationship, nor do they make up a structured organization. Still, they share some common characteristics, such as being composed of former members of the guerrilla and occupying areas that were previously controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC).These groups have a presence in at least 20 departments in Colombia, including along the borders with Venezuela, Brazil, and Ecuador. The ex-FARC mafia seeks to control criminal economies such as drug trafficking and illegal gold mining along these border areas.The most important factions of the ex-FARC mafia are the factions allied to Néstor Gregorio Vera Fernández, alias ""Iván Mordisco,"" and those belonging to the Second Marquetalia, a group led by Luciano Marín, alias ""Iván Márquez."" Both of these larger groups operate in both Colombia and Venezuela. There are also several small, more independent structures such as the 36th Front in Antioquia and the Oliver Sinisterra Front (Frente Oliver Sinisterra - FOS) in Nariño.While the number of combatants across all ex-FARC mafia groups is uncertain, current estimates place the figure at around 2,500. The entire ex-FARC mafia network, however, has been weakened by the repeated killings of top leaders in 2021 and 2022.","Internal divisions within the FARC, regarding the peace process with the Colombian government, started to become evident shortly after negotiations began. Despite the guerrilla group's leadership demonstrating its willingness to put an end to more than half a century of armed violence, some of the organization's most important group leaders entered the process with doubts or did not participate at all.The first to distance himself from the FARC was Néstor Gregorio Vera Fernández, alias ""Iván Mordisco,"" commander of the infamous 1st Front, or Armando Ríos Front In July 2016, the 1st Front informed negotiators of its decision to withdraw from the peace process and would not turn over its weapons via a press release. Additionally, it claimed that the unit would remain in place to combat the structural causes of the armed conflict.In response to this situation, the FARC Secretariat in Cuba, ordered Miguel Botache Santillana, alias ""Gentil Duarte,"" to return to Colombia to take up command of the 1st Front and restore discipline. With more than thirty years of experience as a guerrilla fighter and political leader, Gentil Duarte had been an active negotiator in peace talks since 2012.However, upon arriving in Guaviare, where the 1st Front is located, Iván Mordisco proposed that Gentil Duarte join the dissident movement and continue controlling drug trafficking to the south of the country. Gentil Duarte accepted this proposal and abandoned the peace process at the end of 2016, escaping with $1.35 million and several of his men from the 7th Front, who formed the first FARC dissidence.This turn of events had serious implications for the future of the process. After learning of Duarte's departure, the Secretariat expelled four other commanders from its ranks that had also been opposed to the negotiations. Among those expelled were: Géner García Molina, alias ""Jhon 40;"" Luis Lizcano Guadrón, alias ""Euclides Mora;"" Miguel Díaz San Martín, ""Julián Chollo,"" and Ernesto Orjuela Tovar, alias ""Giovanny Chuspas.""Since then, thousands of members from across the FARC's ranks have left the peace process to return to illegal activities, strengthening the different groups included within the ex-FARC mafia.One of the watershed moments for the ex-FARC came in in August 2019. A a video was released in which Luciano Marín Arango, alias ""Iván Márquez,"" Seuxis Pausias Hernández, alias ""Jesús Santrich,"" and Hernán Darío Velásquez, alias ""El Paisa,"" announced the ""birth of the Second Marquetalia"" due to the ""treason of the State"" in regards to the peace agreement.Márquez, the only commander to speak in the video, explained that the group would embrace the legacy of the FARC and that it would accept any former guerrillas within its ranks.Around 37 criminal units linked to the ex-FARC mafia have been identified up until now. However, these differ widely in their structure, arsenals, leadership, alliances, participation in illegal economies, and even in their levels of social and ideological control.In this sense, each group seeks to expand its own control in different criminal economies. Some have focused on illegal mining in Colombia's Cauca and Valle del Cauca, others on the production and movement of drugs, particularly along routes headed toward Venezuela, Ecuador and Brazil.Another difference between most ex-FARC mafia groups and the now-defunct FARC is in their use of violence. To the ex-FARC mafia, using violence to dominate and control territory is crucial to allow criminal economies to flourish.And while some structures do exercise a level of criminal governance more akin to the FARC, such efforts appear more focused on protecting criminal revenue than in pursuing a political ideal.The only major to fall outside of this spectrum is the Second Marquetalia led by Márquez. This group claims to want to continue the FARC's ""political struggle,"" demonstrating an attitude close to that of the original FARC. However, its ability to do so, given stalled recruitment and the losses of key leaders, is in serious doubt.The last two years have been bitterly difficult for the ex-FARC mafia, coming under prolonged pressure from Colombian and Venezuelan authorities, as well as engaging in clashes with each other and the ELN. At least six high-profile leaders have fallen since May 2021, including legendary figures from before demobilizations and prominent commanders who had risen to the fore in recent years.LeadershipThe dissident elements that make up the ex-FARC mafia operate more like a federation, in which different leaders coordinate actions according to their economic and commercial interests, rather than working as a hierarchical organization.A clear example of this organization model is how the 1st and 7th Fronts, under the leadership of Iván Mordisco and Gentil Duarte, respectively, operated. Prior to Duarte's death, he and Mordisco were in charge of their respective fronts, but maintain an alliance so as to control territory and the drug trafficking routes to Venezuela and Brazil that pass through the departments of Guaviare, Vaupés and Guainía.Today, following the death of Gentil Duarte, it is presumed that Iván Mordisco assumed control of the 7th Front.Géner García Molina, alias Jhon 40, was another important FARC dissident leader. Thanks to his control of drug trafficking routes in southeastern Colombia and border crossings into Venezuela, he controls the Acacio Medina Front, a dissident faction in the Venezuelan Amazon and the Colombian department of Guainía. While his loyalties have often been uncertain, he most recently was aligned with the Second Marquetalia.In the same way, the Second Marquetalia seems to function more as an alliance than as leaders and subordinates, as each dissident front contributes an important dimension to the group. Márquez offers the group continuity, having previously been the second in command of the FARC. However, the deaths of Santrich, El Paisa, and Romaña, along with Márquez's suspected death and confirmed health problems, have cost the group not only experienced commanders, but also ideological weight.","While the ex-FARC Mafia structures do not exercise complete control of the territories where they operate, at present, their presence is registered in the Colombian departments of Amazonas, Casanare, Córdoba, Arauca, Nariño, Putumayo, Cauca, Valle del Cauca, Antioquia, Meta, Caquetá, Guaviare, Tolima, Huila, and Guainía.These departments are the scene of a wide portfolio of criminal activities, like coca crops, illegal mining, and drug trafficking, as well as an export point for drugs destined for international markets, among them the border areas with Venezuela, Brazil and Ecuador.Venezuela has also become a crucial destination for certain ex-FARC Mafia groups. Structures like the Acacio Medina Front, led by Jhon 40, the 1st Front, and the 10th Front, maintain a presence in the states of Amazonas, Apure, Bolívar, Guárico, Mérida, Barinas, Táchira and Zulia, which allow them to control key areas for drug trafficking, extortion, illegal mining and contraband smuggling,","As a result of the multiple groups that make up the ex-FARC mafia, it is difficult to precisely chart which groups are allies and enemies, as these vary widely and depend on the areas in which they operate.Ex-FARC mafia groups have readily created alliances with other criminal groups if this allows them to maintain strategic control of key areas and criminal economies. These alliances can be diverse and often compete with each other as ex-FARC mafia groups have at different times allied with the ELN, the Urabeños, and the Caparros.In the same vein, disputes that have occurred among ex-FARC mafia groups have also revolved around the need to preserve or expand their control of Colombia's strategic locations.In other cases, disputes between dissident factions have plunged the country into violence. In Nariño, various ex-FARC groups are disputing control of coca crops and drug trafficking routes towards the Pacific. Along the border with Venezuela, the 10th Front has been attacked by Venezuelan armed forces – who allegedly acted to advance the interests of the Second Marquetalia – in a military campaign that generated the displacement of thousands of people to Colombia.Additionally, in January 2022, dissidents of the 10th Front in Arauca and Apure, Venezuela, started a violent war against the ELN for territorial control.","The ex-FARC mafia represent one of the main security risks in Colombia, due to its rapid growth, its control of strategic areas around the country, and its ability to strike at the civilian population, armed forces, and other criminal groups.However, the main characteristic of the ex-FARC is that it does not exist as a homogenous group, it is a collection of different groups with different characteristics, interests and perspectives.For example, the Oliver Sinisterra Front (FOS), at one point the most violent of ex-FARC dissident groups in Nariño, had weakened so much by early 2020 that it split into smaller groups that are currently fighting each other. Meanwhile, other groups, like the Border Command in Putumayo and the Jaime Martínez and Dagoberto Ramos Mobile Columns in Cauca, have quickly gained strength.Considering this, it is projected that all of these ex-FARC groups will end up falling into three important segments, but without forming a unified structure.The first segment, and probably the largest, would be led by Iván Mordisco. This group exists as a criminal federation, where each group fills out specific objections or carries out operations of interest but ultimately remains relatively independent.Although the presence of this segment could be felt in different departments, its criminal strongholds would be Guaviare, Meta, Caquetá, Amazonas, Guainía and Vichada, where the 1st, 7th, and 16th Fronts control cocaine trafficking.The second segment would be the Second Marquetalia led by Iván Márquez. Despite the fact that he carries the FARC's political and ideological banner, his group has struggled to make a real difference.While they have gained the support of some already established dissident groups, the ex-FARC fronts attached to the Second Marquetalia appear, in general, to have little capacity to act, despite having a presence in key areas such as Norte de Santander, Bolívar, Cauca and Nariño.The most notable exception would be the Border Command, who are in conflict with the Carolina Ramirez First Front, allied with Iván Mordisco, for control of Putumayo.Finally, a group of independent ex-FARC mafia groups looms on the horizon. These structures would not fall under the umbrella of larger organizations and instead seek to consolidate their individual criminal strength.This is true for groups like the Oliver Sinisterra Front in Nariño, which is directly involved in drug trafficking in its areas of control and with no apparent intentions to enter a larger structure.It is likely that this growth will result in clashes between the different ex-FARC elements.Meanwhile, Venezuela will also play a crucial role, as its political and economic crisis provide freedom of movement for the groups, ample streams of criminal income, and a market that is dollarized in practice, which facilitates money laundering and arms trafficking.",,
Monos,https://insightcrime.org/argentina-organized-crime-news/los-monos/,Monos,,./images/organizations/monos.jpg,2022-04-28,"['argentina groups', 'los monos']",argentina,"The criminal group known as the Monos, led by members of the Cantero family, has been operating for more than 20 years in the Argentine city of Rosario.Their sophisticated relationships with members of the security forces, businessmen and other local elites, as well as their use of violence have allowed the Monos to control illicit economies, such as micro-trafficking, throughout the city.Despite a trial that resulted in many of the group’s leaders and members landing behind bars in 2018, the group continues to operate and contribute to the wave of violence tearing through the city of Rosario.","The criminal history of the Cantero Clan, the family heading up the Monos, began in the late 1990s. At that time, members of the Cantero family, under the patriarchal command of Ariel Cantero, alias “El Viejo,” loaned security services to Rosario’s most marginalized neighborhoods and coordinated marijuana shipments from Paraguay.Rosario is strategically located as a transit point for drug shipments coming from neighboring Bolivia and Paraguay. The main trafficking route is Route 34 that starts at the border with Bolivia and ends in Rosario.It was not until the beginning of 2004 that the criminal group set its sights on the lucrative micro-trafficking business in areas they controlled.As Argentina emerged from one of the severest economic crises in its history, the country was left greatly marginalized and with a high poverty rate. The Monos took advantage of the economic situation to position themselves as the “de facto” authority in large areas to the south of Rosario. They managed this with the help of strong connections with security forces, construction companies that sought land during the post-recession construction boom, car dealerships which the gang used for money laundering, and in politics, which are essential in a country where voting is mandatory.They started to recruit marginalized youth to work in “bunkers,” small brick structures scattered throughout Rosario’s marginalized neighborhoods, where they would sell drugs in small quantities. Over time, the number of bunkers grew and kids with hands small enough to pass cocaine doses through the bunker windows became known as “soldaditos” (small soldiers.)Business prospered and the group continued to consolidate, until two high-profile murders led to a wave of violence that put Rosario and the Monos at the center of public attention.On September 8, 2012, Martín Paz, alias “El Fantasma,” was killed in cold blood in broad daylight in the center of Rosario.It is believed that El Fantasma had been laundering money for the Cantero family through his car dealership and occasionally transported drugs for them. However, his connection to the Canteros ran deeper. He was married to the sister of Claudio Ariel Cantero, alias “El Pájaro,” the son of Monos leader, El Viejo.Shortly before being killed, El Fantasma had organized the arrival of a cocaine shipment from Bolivia with Cantero family money. However, the shipment was confiscated by the Argentine police on the Bolivian border. El Fantasma lost the drugs and the money and the Canteros, particularly El Pájaro, saw this as treason.Eight months after El Fantasma’s murder, in the early hours of May 26, 2013, El Pájaro was shot dead as he left a night club. Following El Pájaro’s death, his brother Ariel Máximo Cantero, alias “Guille,” assumed leadership of the Monos.El Pájaro’s murder generated a wave of indiscriminate violence. In the week following his death, four people were murdered and the homicide rate in Rosario shot up to fa higher than the national average.The social pressure generated by the wave of violence forced the government to act. In April 2014, Argentina’s then-security minister, Sergio Berni, led a Hollywood-esque raid by the national police to dismantle Rosario’s bunkers. This militarized strategy has continued under the current administration of President Mauricio Macri.The crimes also led to one of the most intensive and widely publicized criminal investigations in Argentina’s recent history. The investigation lasted several years and was based primarily on evidence collected through intercepted phone calls. The case shined light on an intricate criminal network that involved criminal groups, the police, and businessmen from Rosario, as well as other Argentine provinces.On April 9, 2018, in what was widely seen as an historical court decision, the then-leaders of the Monos, Guille and Monchi, were sentenced to 37 and 22 years in jail respectively on charges of illicit association and homicide. El Viejo received a six-year prison sentence for involvement with an illegal organization. Many of the group's other prominent figures were also sentenced (see below).Additionally, nine local police agents were found guilty of belonging to the Monos.The group has managed to keep its drug business alive, however. Despite the group’s leaders being behind bars, violence has continued to be used to intimidate and get revenge on judges, prosecutors and witnesses in Rosario.In 2018, just days after the group’s current leader, Ariel Máximo Cantero, alias “Guille,” was sentenced to prison, a gunman opened fire on the house of one of the judges. This was just the first of a series of attacks for which Cantero and other members of the Monos, face trial in 2021.Despite being on trial for ordering attacks on judicial authorities and entities, Cantero directly threatened the judge during a court appearance on August 20. When asked about his profession at the beginning of the court hearing, Cantero responded:  “I contract hitmen to shoot judges.”Clan members have been transferred to different prisons, with the intention of curbing their communication with the outside world and thereby their ability to influence Rosario's criminal landscape. Unfortunately, this strategy has had little success.","The Monos operate through family ties, resulting in a unique level of trust.This was evident when Claudio Cantero was murdered and his younger brother Ariel Máximo Cantero assumed leadership of the criminal organization, along with the family’s foster child, Ramón Manchuca, alias “Monchi,” and Jorge Emanuel Chamorro, alias “Ema,” a family friend and hitman.A significant part of the criminal group’s leadership is currently behind bars, but this has not stopped the group’s operations.The group’s leader, Ariel Máximo Cantero, alias “Guille,” is among several members of the Monos currently facing trial for money laundering and ordering attacks on legal authorities and judicial centers during the 2018 trial against 34 of the group’s members.Cantero is currently completing a 22-year sentence for illicit association and homicide as well a separate 15-year sentence for drug trafficking. In April 2019, Guille was also indicted, along with another member of the Monos, Leandro Vilches, alias “Gordo,” for leading drug trafficking operations from prison between 2015 and 2016.Ramón Manchuca, alias “Monchi,” the family’s foster child, is serving a 37-year sentence for illicit associations and homicide. Jorge Emanuel Chamorro, alias “Ema,” a family friend and gang hitman, was sentenced to 12 years of prison for illicit associations and being an accomplice to a homicide and 17 years for drug trafficking.Vanessa Barrios, Guille’s wife, and Jésica Lloan, Ema’s girlfriend, were sentenced to 12 years for coordinating drug production and sales under the orders of their partners while they were held in the Piñero prison, located 20 kilometers from Rosario.The group’s family patriarch, Ariel Cantero, alias “El Viejo,” who was sentenced to eight years in prison for being a member of an illicit organization, was granted a reduction in his prison sentence during the COVID-19 pandemic for finishing primary school while in prison and was released on parole in 2020 He was, however, re-arrested in April 2022 for allegedly planning a series of attacks on petrol stations and a school in late 2021. The family matriarch, Patricia Celestina Contreras de Cantero, alias “La Cele,” was sentenced to eight years of house arrest on charges of leading a criminal organization.","For the past two decades, the Monos have primarily been focused on the city of Rosario, in Argentina’s Santa Fe province.The city is a strategically located spot for drug shipments coming from Bolivia and Paraguay. It is also the endpoint for Route 34 that starts on the Bolivian border and ends in Rosario, along which numerous drug shipments are sent.While the Monos have contacts in other parts of the country, they primarily focus on the Argentina provinces that border Paraguay and Bolivia, from where they receive shipments of marijuana and cocaine.","The Monos’ success was in no small part due to their strong criminal ties to local police, prison staff, businessmen, and even the heads of Rosario's “barras bravas” or soccer gangs. They also managed to establish links with drug producers and distributors in other provinces in Northern Argentina, as well as in neighboring Paraguay and Bolivia.These links allowed them to manage their drug retail business almost without interference for years, laundering their illicit profits and managing their business even when while behind bars.However, two murders in 2012 changed all that. Martín Paz, alias “El Fantasma,” a Monos ally thought to have finally betrayed them and Claudio Ariel Cantero, “El Pájaro,” slain in revenge a few months later in what was seen as a retribution killing, triggered a battle between different factions and criminal groups looking to control the territory.Members of other familiar clans and smaller criminal organizations, both in size and influence, have tried to challenge the Monos’ hegemony in Rosario. Among the groups challenging the Monos are the Alvarado, Ungaros and the Funes.","Despite being behind bars, the Monos' leaders have continued to use their connections to keep the group’s criminal activities ticking along.With a growing drug consumption market in Argentina, Rosario’s criminal groups, including the Monos, continue to have fertile ground on which to maintain operations.However, the length of prison stays for key members of the Monos suggests that the group’s glory days may be behind them.",
Caparros,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/los-caparrapos/,Caparros,,./images/organizations/caparros.jpg,2022-08-27,"['auc', 'colombia', 'colombia groups', 'ex-farc mafia', 'farc', 'gaitanistas', 'los caparrapos']",colombia,"The Caparros, also known as the Virgilio Peralta Arenas Front and the Caparrapos, is a criminal gang that is heavily involved in drug trafficking in Colombia’s Antioquia and Córdoba departments.Previously seen as a part of the Urabeños, the criminal group started a dispute with its former partners for the control of drug trafficking and illegal gold mining in northwestern Colombia.After the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia’s (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) former 18th and 36th Fronts, the Caparros carved out a presence in Bajo Cauca in Antioquia, especially in the municipalities of Tarazá, Cáceres, Caucasia and El Bagre, as well as in southern Córdoba in the municipalities of San José de Uré, Montelíbano and Pueblo Nuevo. They have created strategic, though fragile, localized alliances with elements of the ex-FARC Mafia and the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) guerrillas.In June 2021, the Colombian government declared that the Caparros had been completely dismantled but this may prove to be far too optimistic a judgment, given the country's history of criminal recycling.In August 2022, the Caparros were included in a list of criminal groups which the new government of President Gustavo Petro wanted to negotiate with.","There are two versions concerning the creation of the Caparros. The first states that, in 1996, Carlos Mario Jiménez Naranjo, alias “Macaco,” brought together a group of people linked to paramilitary groups in Caparrapí, Cundinamarca, and created the Caparros. But a second version comes from an interview carried out by El Colombiano with a Caparros commander known as alias “40”, in which he states that the group is the successor of the Mineros Bloc of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC).As part of the expansion of paramilitary groups seen in the 2000s, the AUC were fighting for control over strategic such as Segovia, Zaragoza, Tarazá and El Bagre in Antioquia, San José de Uré in Córdoba, and Simití in Bolívar. Among the ranks of the AUC's Mineros Bloc, Virgilio Peralta Arenas, alias “Víctor Caparrapo,” who hailed from Caparrapí, rapidly gained in power. After the AUC demobilized in 2006, the Caparros were founded from dissident elements that refused to disarm, mostly made up of members of the former Mineros Bloc.But the Caparros believed strength lay in unity. They joined the recently created the Urabeños in 2009, which had also managed an alliance with the Paisas. Likewise, they reached a tacit agreement with the FARC, based on a geographical delimitation that would allow all criminal actors to trafficking corridors for weapons, chemical inputs, coca paste, cocaine and precious metals.The Caparros were renamed the Virgilio Peralta Arena Front as part of the Urabeños, although they maintained territorial and criminal autonomy, including control of extortion, illegal mining and cocaine production, according to risk reports from the Colombia Ombudsman’s Office.However, the criminal scenario of Bajo Cauca and southern Córdoba has changed once again with the beginning of the FARC demobilization in 2017 and the constant blows to the Urabeños from Operations Agamemnon I and II.The Caparros were able to expand to territories left by the 18th and 36th Fronts of the former FARC guerrilla. This was a process that saw the group gradually withdraw from the Urabeños and begin a dispute for territorial control, beginning in early 2017.Since late 2016, the Urabeños had tried to expand from west to eastern Antioquia, especially to Ituango and later to Valdivia and Yarumal. They recruited young people from Medellín, set up access restrictions and distributed pamphlets in the region.      SEE ALSO: Urabeños News and ProfileSimultaneously, in Cáceres, Antioquia and Tarazá, Córdoba, the group entered armed conflict with the Julio Cesar Vargas Front of the Urabeños as the latter sought to gain full control of coca processing areas and trafficking routes, formerly assigned to the Caparros and the Paisas. For their part, the Caparros sought to sell the rights to the territory assigned to them by the Urabeños to a leader of the Oficina de Envigado.The Caparros sought to prosper through alliances, such as with the Paisas and with elements of the ex-FARC mafia's 18th Front, in municipalities such as Puerto Libertador in Córdoba, from early 2018. Similarly, they established a partnership with Ricardo Abel Ayala, alias “Cabuyo,” chief of the 36th Front dissidents, through which they established regulations for the price and purchase of coca paste in Briceño and Valdivia.In order to continue gathering strength in Bajo Cauca, the Caparros also managed a temporary alliance with the ELN guerrilla group, as reported by local communities who witnessed the two groups carrying out joint military operations.On these grounds, the Caparros became one of the major criminal groups in the region. They grew through their alliances, engaging drug trafficking, extortion and even forced recruitment of minors, allowing them to currently count with at least 450 members.","The Caparros are involved in all stages of drug trafficking in the Antioquia and Córdoba departments. In the Urabá subregion, they control coca plantations, its transformation into cocaine and its shipping to international markets. According to official government data, the group currently controls up to 12,000 hectares of coca leaf plantations.The group is also involved in illegal mining, and they have muscled into this trade in the municipalities of Caucasia and Bagre, known for their long mining tradition. The criminal group is reported to have been drawing a monthly minimum profit of $725,000, from just one rural area of El Bagre.","José Horacio Abello, alias “Seis-Siete,” was the highest commander of the Caparros until his capture in March 2017. He was replaced by Emiliano Alcides Osorio Maceas, alias “Pilatos” or “Caín.”Cain was killed by security forces in November 2020, leaving Robinson Gil Tapias, alias “Flechas,” as the new head of the group.However, Flechas did not last long as he was also killed during an army raid in the municipality of Cáceres in Antioquianto de Piamonte, municipio de Cáceres en Antioquia.The Caparros are divided into three fronts: the Elmer Ordoñez Beltrán; the Carlos Mario Tabares, which had been led by Flechas, and the Norberto Olivares Front, led by Jhon Freddy Miranda, alias el “Evangélico.""Other senior members of the group include “El Negro Romaña,” who is a high-ranking commander and in charge of extortion and alias ""La Paisa,"" allegedly overseeing logistics and microtrafficking.","Since their beginnings, the Caparros have exerted influence in the area of Bajo Cauca in Antioquia. They currently have a presence in the municipalities of Cáceres, Tarazá and Caucasia also in Antioquia. The withdrawal of the FARC, along with the Caparros’ criminal alliances, allowed them to extend to Yarumales, Valdivia, Briceño, El Bagre, and Nechí in northern Antioquia; and Puerto Libertador and San José de Uré, in southern Córdoba.","Presently, the Caparros are associated with the Paisas. The main objective of the alliance is to control the trafficking corridor connecting the center of the country with the coast of Córdoba, Sucre and the Gulf of Urabá. They also have alliances with the ex-FARC Mafia’s 18th and 36th Fronts, as well as with the ELN, although these seem to be temporary in nature, based on accomplishing specific mutually beneficial goals.On the other hand, the primary enemies of the Caparros are the Urabeños: the Julio César Vargas Front, which they fight in the rural area of Cáceres; the Francisco Morelos Peñate Front, with whom they dispute the municipality of Caucasia; and the Rubén Darío Ávila Front in the north of Tarazá around the borders of San José de Uré in Córdoba and Ituango in Antioquía.","The Caparros have proven to be highly adaptable, willing to make alliances with new groups and blend within larger structures. Thanks to this, they managed to survive after the demobilization of the AUC and seem to have used the same strategy when the Urabeños weakened somewhat.Their knowledge of specific terrain and drug trafficking routes has allowed the Caparros to maintain control of strategic areas of Antioquia. However, this will not come at a low cost: the armed conflict with the Urabeños shows no sign of abating.The recent losses of Cain and Flechas at the hands of Colombian authorities leave the group in a vulnerable position.In June 2021, the Colombian government declared that the Caparros had been completely dismantled but this may prove to be far too optimistic a judgment, given the country's history of criminal recycling."
Jalisco Cartel New Generation (CJNG),https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/jalisco-cartel-new-generation/,Jalisco Cartel New Generation (CJNG),,./images/organizations/jalisco-cartel-new-generation-(cjng).jpg,2020-07-08,"['jalisco cartel', 'mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"The Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación - CJNG) is a criminal group that has evolved as a result of killings, captures and rifts in older cartels. It is known for its aggressive use of violence and its public relations campaigns. Despite the capture of certain top leaders, it is now Mexico's foremost criminal threat and appears set to continue expanding.","The CJNG emerged after former Sinaloa Cartel capo Ignacio Coronel, alias ""Nacho,"" was killed by Mexican security forces in July 2010. Prior to his death, Coronel gave orders to Óscar Orlando Nava Valencia, alias ""El Lobo,"" the leader of the Milenio Cartel. This criminal group moved drug shipments and managed finances for the Sinaloa Cartel, operating primarily in the states of Jalisco and Colima, and later extending into Michoacán and Mexico City.By the time of Nacho Coronel's death, El Lobo had been captured and the Milenio Cartel had suffered internal divisions, splitting into two factions: ""La Resistencia"" and another faction referred to as the ""Torcidos"" (""The Twisted Ones""), because La Resistencia accused them of giving up El Lobo to the authorities.In the power vacuum that followed Nacho's death, these two groups fought for control of drug trafficking in Jalisco. The Torcidos became what is now the CJNG, emerging as the successors to the Sinaloan capo's network in the region.Nemesio Oseguera Ramos, alias ""El Mencho,"" is considered the leader and founder of the CJNG, and his original top operators were Erick Valencia, alias ""El 85,"" and Martin Arzola Ortega, alias ""El 53."" All of these men were former Milenio Cartel members.The group has been associated with the use of extreme violence. In the period following the emergence of the CJNG, homicides, forced disappearances and the discoveries of mass graves spiked in Jalisco. The cartel also made it one of its early missions to battle the Zetas drug trafficking organization in Veracruz state, under the name ""Matazetas,"" or ""Zetas Killers,"" which, depending on the source, is described as either another name for the CJNG or a special cell of the group responsible for assassinations. The group claimed authorship of a 2011 massacre of 35 people in Veracruz, and a month later security forces recovered the corpses of around 30 apparent victims of the group.In April 2015, the CJNG killed 15 Mexican police officers during an ambush in Jalisco state, one of the single deadliest attacks on security forces in recent Mexican history. The group was also blamed for an attack in March 2015 that killed five federal police. Additionally, Mexican officials have previously indicated that the group possesses highly sophisticated armament, including machine guns and grenade launchers were used to conduct the March 2015 attack. In May 2015, the group continued its deadly streak, shooting down a military helicopter on May 1 and launching a wave of violence across Jalisco.The CJNG has also been involved in high-profile attacks against public officials. In May 2018, the group tried to assassinate Luis Carlos Nájera, former security secretary of Jalisco and in June 2020, it made a bold attempt to kill Omar García Harfuch, Mexico City's public security secretary. That same month, a judge in the western state of Colima, who had tried various cases against members of the cartel, was killed along with his wife.The CJNG has also been known to appeal to the Mexican citizenry with idealistic propaganda, invoking solidarity and promising to rid its areas of operation of other crime syndicates, such as the Zetas and the Knights Templar in the past.The group has continued such outwardly ""altruistic"" actions in strategic areas during the coronavirus pandemic. In June 2020, for example, the group distributed toys to children in communities in Veracruz where it is fighting splinter groups from Los Zetas. And members of the CJNG also delivered boxes of goods in various parts of the country, including Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city.","The CJNG is currently led by Nemesio Oseguera Ramos, alias ""El Mencho.""  For information leading to his arrest, the US has offered a reward of $10 million, one of the highest bounties ever offered. Mexico has offered its own reward of 30 million pesos ($1.6 million).The US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has also identified other senior figures such as Erick Valencia Salazar, alias “El 85,” who faces a reward of $5 million for his capture, Ulises Mora Tapia, José Manuel Abouzaid El Bayeh and Alfredo Galindo Salazar.","The group has expanded rapidly, and the CJNG now has some sort of presence in every part of Mexico, except Sinaloa and the Golden Triangle of heroin production.However, the CJNG does not necessarily control every area it is present in. It is truly the dominant criminal actor in Jalisco, Nayarit and Colima, at the port of Lázaro Cárdenas in Michoacán, in the eastern state of Veracruz and in the oil-rich central region of Guanajuato, Puebla, Querétaro and Hidalgo.It is also strong, although facing stern rivalries, in strategic areas such as the border cities of Tijuana and Juárez, Tierra Caliente – the area which covers parts of Michoacán, Guerrero and the State of Mexico –, and the Riviera Maya.The group has shown it may be focusing on entering the capital, after a brazen attack against Mexico City's public security secretary in June 2020.Internationally, the cartel has contacts in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, the US, Central America, Canada, Australia, China and Southeast Asia, which help it control large parts of marijuana, cocaine and synthetic drug trafficking in Mexico.","The CJNG's longest ally were Los Cuinis, led by Abigael González Valencia, the brother-in-law of El Mencho. However, the precise nature of this relationship has never been fully clarified as some reports described Los Cuinis as the financial arm of the CJNG, while others viewed it as a separate, if associated, organization. And with the arrest of many of the leaders of the González Valencia, the power and influence of Los Cuinis appears to have waned dramatically.While it is possible the CJNG once maintained an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel, today, the two are fierce enemies across large parts of Mexico. The CJNG has also not hesitated to go after top leaders within the Sinaloa Cartel. In August 2016, two of the sons of Sinaloa Cartel leader, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias “El Chapo,” were briefly kidnapped by the CJNG,Besides Sinaloa, the CJNG is facing a number of smaller, localized rivals, a result of the fragmentation which has broken up many of Mexico's larger criminal groups.Some of these smaller gangs have also allied themselves with the CJNG. In Tijuana, for example, it has joined forces with remnants of the now-defunct Tijuana Cartel to create the Tijuana Cartel New Generation (Cartel Tijuana Nueva Generación). And in Ciudad Juárez, reports have emerged that the CJNG is making strides in the city through an alliance with a faction of the Juárez Cartel.In the central state of Guanjuato, the group has been embroiled in a bloody war with the Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel (Cartel de Santa Rosa de Lima - CSRL), led by José Antonio Yépez Ortiz, alias “El Marro,” since 2017. This battle has revolved around control of oil theft in the state and led to Guanajuato becoming the most violent state in Mexico. In recent months, the CJNG appears to have taken a decisive advantage over the CSRL, whose control has dwindled to a few municipalitiies.On the Atlantic Coast, the CJNG has moved into Veracruz, where it has faced the Old School Zetas (Zetas Vieja Escuela), a splinter group of Los Zetas, and a dissident faction of the Gulf Cartel, known as Grupo Sombra. In April 2019, the CJNG massacred 14 people in the municipality of Minatitlán, a stronghold of the Zetas Vieja Escuela.One of its oldest enemies was the Knights Templar although this group has now fragmented into several smaller organizations. The largest of these splinter groups is Los Viagras, which has established itself as a force to be reckoned with in Tierra Caliente and has frequently clashed with the CJNG.There have also been reports of alliances between the CJNG and a number of vigilante groups, known as ""autodefensas,"" in the region, including that the CJNG had provided high-caliber weaponry to these groups. However, the CJNG has also consistently battled the Cartel del Abuelo, a group local to Michoacán which began as an autodefensa.Finally, while the CJNG has succeeded in remaining united where other groups have fragmented, it has not been immune to internal divisions. The main one came in 2017, when a group calling itself the Nueva Plaza Cartel, broke off after an alleged dispute over an assassination order. While the Nueva Plaza Cartel has not been able to really threaten the CJNG inside their base of operations, Guadalajara, it maintains a measure of control over some areas to the west and southwest of the city.","The fragmentation process of numerous criminal groups in Mexico has allowed the CJNG - which has maintained its hierarchy and discipline relatively intact - to continue gaining power in recent years.The biggest hit it took was the dismantling of Los Cuinis, a group run by the González Valencia family which acted as the CJNG's financial and money laundering arm. Many of the leaders of Los Cuinis have now been arrested, likely ending much of the group's influence.And the children of El Mencho have also been targeted. His son, Rubén Oseguera Gonzáez, alias “El Menchito”, was extradited to the United States in February 2020 while his daughter, Jessica Johanna Oseguera, was detained that same month and is currently awaiting trial.On another front, Mexican authorities have gone after its finances. In June 2020, around 2,000 bank accounts linked to the group were frozen and a number of front companies used to launder money in Jalisco, Quintana Roo and Mexico City were shut down.Despite these blows, the CJNG's operations have appeared to remain intact and it has continued its expansion.",

The organization was formed in the late 1990s by ex-members of the powerful Red Command (Comando Vermelho) who broke off to fight the group’s dominance by pairing up with corrupt current and former members of the security forces. Amigos dos Amigos is one of Rio’s biggest drug trafficking organizations, but recent dissidence by high-ranking members and clashes with rival groups for territorial control are currently weakening its stronghold.","Amigos dos Amigos was founded in 1998 by criminals Celso Luis Rodrigues, alias “Celsinho da Vila Vintem,” and Ernaldo Pinto de Medeiros, alias “Ue,” who left Brazil’s oldest criminal group the Red Command and paired up with drug traffickers and former and current soldiers, marines and police officers. Ue had been expelled from the Red Command in 1994 for ordering the killing of leader Orlando da Conceição, alias “Orlando Jogador.”The newly formed Amigos dos Amigos, like many other criminal groups emerging in Rio de Janeiro during the mid to late-1990s, sought to cash in on the city’s fast-growing demand for drugs. In order to fight off the dominant Red Command, the new group joined forces with the Third Command (Terceiro Comando), another group founded by dissident ex-Red Command members in the 1980s.The emergence of Amigos dos Amigos caused the outbreak of new battles for territory in Rio. In turn, dissident members of the Third Command who opposed the new alliance broke away to form the Pure Capital Command (Terceiro Comando Puro – TCP), another competing Rio gang, and now one of Amigos dos Amigos’ biggest rivals.Founding member Eu was killed in a prison riot in 2002, orchestrated by Red Command leader Luiz Fernando da Costa, alias “Fernandinho Beira-Mar.” Antônio Francisco Bonfim Lopes, alias “Nem,” took over control as the Amigos dos Amigos’ top boss.The organization expanded quickly, dominating most of Rio’s north and west zones in the early 2000s. By 2004, Amigos dos Amigos took over the Red Command’s control of Rio’s largest favela, Rocinha, and held it unopposed until 2011, when Nem’s arrest sparked ongoing turf wars.Amigos dos Amigos is thought to wield significant social power in the communities it controls, working to win residents’ support by providing services, throwing parties and distributing handouts, while the Red Command more often imposes itself through violence.Amigos dos Amigos broke into international headlines in October 2009 when a police helicopter crashed in the favela Morro dos Macacos, which was controlled by the group. The police pilot lost control after getting caught in the crossfire of a gun battle started by Red Command members launching an unsuccessful bid to take over the neighborhood.Amigos dos Amigos once again entered the spotlight in 2014 when a faction led by Celso Pinheiro Pimenta, alias “Playboy,” broke into a pool set to be used for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio and posed for photos swimming with assault rifles. Ahead of the Olympics, the Amigos dos Amigos and Rio’s two other largest criminal groups, the Red Command and Pure Third Command, engaged in shootouts with each other and security forces during intensifying disputes for territorial control.By 2016, Amigos dos Amigos was rumored to have formed a partnership with the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC), the most powerful and best-organized criminal structure in Brazil. That year, tensions between the São Paulo-based PCC and the Red Command mounted in Rio and across the country following the breakdown of a long-standing alliance between the two groups.Gun battles in Rocinha escalated in late 2017 when Rogério 157, Nem’s former second-in-command, broke from Amigos dos Amigos and joined forces with the rival Red Command in an attempt to take over the neighborhood's profitable drug trade. Rogério 157 was arrested in December 2017, but is likely continuing to conduct criminal activities from prison.","Amigos dos Amigos’ top leader Nem was captured by police in 2011 ahead of an occupation of Rocinha carried out as part of a flawed police pacification program. Although Nem is reported to have continued running the group from prison, in his absence, rival groups like the Red Command and dissident former members like Nem’s ex-bodyguard Rogério 157 are fighting for control of the group’s strongholds.","Amigos dos Amigos’ main area of operations is Rocinha, one of Rio de Janeiro’s largest favelas, located in the city’s south zone. This area provides the group with lucrative drug trafficking routes and markets, but the territory is currently under violent despite with rivals.","Amigos dos Amigos’ biggest enemies are the Rio-based Red Command and Pure Third Command. A security crackdown launched in 2008 temporarily weakened the Amigos dos Amigos and the Red Command, tempering attacks that resumed in late 2015.According to security experts consulted by InSight Crime in 2017, Amigos dos Amigos may have partnered with the São Paulo-based PCC gang, which is reportedly trying to weaken the control of its rival, the Red Command, in Rio de Janeiro.","Police operations in the mid-2010s temporarily disrupted the operations of Amigos dos Amigos, but the group managed to regain much of its control over key territory in Rocinha. Nonetheless, current dissidence within the group and increasingly frequent clashes with rivals and security forces may be weakening its control once again.",
1st Front (Ex-FARC Mafia),https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/first-front-dissidence/,1st Front (Ex-FARC Mafia),,./images/organizations/1st-front-(ex-farc-mafia).jpg,2019-07-13,"['colombia groups', 'ex-farc mafia', 'farc', 'farc peace']",colombia,"The 1st Front Dissidence is the most important of the criminal groups comprised of ex-members of the now demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC). It has succeeded in creating alliances with other criminal groups, especially around its operation base of southeastern Colombia, as well as along the borders with Venezuela, Brazil and Ecuador.","As soon as peace negotiations began between the FARC and the Colombian government in Cuba, there was a fear that the 1st Front, also known as the Armando Ríos Front, might attempt to distance itself from the peace process.This was linked to the 1st Front having begun to show a lack of discipline as it gained in economic and military might due to the control it maintained over strategic drug trafficking routes and forced recruitment in Guaviare, Guainía and Vaupés.In July 2016, the 1st Front informed negotiating parties in Havana, Cuba, that it would not demobilize along. From the negotiating table, the FARC leadership minimized the declaration, dismissing it as the actions of merely a few discontented members of the unit. The FARC Secretariat even ordered Miguel Botache Santillana, alias ""Gentil Duarte,"" a member of the FARC’s top leadership with more than 30 years of experience in the organization, to take command of the 1st Front and reestablish discipline. Instead, Gentil Duarte formed an alliance with Néstor Gregorio Vera Fernández, alias “Iván Mordisco,"" and took leadership of the dissident front, then made up of approximately 150 men.After the peace agreement was signed, the FARC confirmed that the majority of the 1st Front had become dissidents and were led by Gentil Duarte, Iván Mordisco and Géner García Molina, alias “Jhon 40”.In April 2017, the 1st Front formalized its criminal with a public letter expressing “dissatisfaction,"" ""rejecting"" the FARC Secretariat’s ""betrayal,"" and inviting ""all combatants that refuse peace"" to join its ranks. The letter was signed by nine dissident fronts, one mobile column and seven urban militias.This would be the first attempt by this dissident group to unite the former FARC groups which sprang up after the FARC demobilized. It was clear evidence of the intent of Gentil Duarte and Iván Mordisco to strengthen the alliances between them and their former guerrilla brethren.Since then, this alliance between Gentil Duarte, Iván Mordisco and Jhon 40 has not stopped growing. The 1st Front has consolidated its structure in the departments of Guaviare y Meta, while maintaining drug trafficking routes from Vichada to Venezuela.They have also expanded through other alliances into the department of Caqueta, where the 1st Front controlled part of the border with Putumayo, thanks to the help of Edgar Mesías Salgado, alias “Rodrigo Cadete,” who joined Duarte's alliance until his death in early 2019. From there, the 1st Front leapt into Putumayo and has made great strides in controlling this heavy coca production area.Here, however, the 1st Front ran into problems, including the refusal of the ex-FARC 48th Front to join them. But after months of fighting, the death of the 48th Front's leader in March 2019 helped the 1st Front gain further ground.Now, the group has seemingly settled on a new objective: the department of Nariño, the jewel in Colombia's drug trafficking crown. Criminal groups there have fought back against 1st Front incursions but recent news seems to show that alliances are being struck, again allowing Gentil Duarte's group to gain ground.","The 1st Front Dissidence began its criminal actions in 2016, focused on consolidating its control of the departments of Meta, Guaviare and Vaupés. This has included attacks against public authorities, forced recruitment, extortion and threats against the public.Since 2016, the dissidence has engaged in criminal activities with the aim of consolidating its power in the departments of Meta, Guaviare and Vaupés. The most common of these criminal activities have included harassing and attacking security forces with explosives, engaging in forced recruitment, and extorting and threatening the civilian population.Currently, the 1st Front controls coca crops in Guaviare as well as cocaine production there, but has expanded rapidly to the south of Meta, with the aim of controlling drug trafficking routes to Vichada and Guainía. It has also begun greater involvement in sending cocaine from Caquetá through the north of Amazonas and into Brazil.The 1st Front is focused on controlling all links in the drug trafficking chain, from production to transportation and sale, which has allowed it to rapidly increase its profits.","The 1st Front dissidence is comprised of at least 400 members, and has a horizontal leadership structure including Miguel Botache Santillana, alias ""Gentil Duarte""; Néstor Gregorio Fernández, alias ""Iván Mordisco""; Géner García Molina, alias ""Jhon 40""; Luis Alfonso Lizcano Gualdron, alias ""Euclides Mora""; and Miguel Díaz Sanmarín, alias ""Julian Chollo.""Although the dissidence is highly mobile, its main operational base is in the village of Barranquillita in Miraflores.","The 1st Front dissidence is the main organization within an alliance of FARC dissidents. The other dissident fronts with which it is allied are the 14th, 15th, 17th, 27th, 33rd, 40th, 42nd, 43rd and 44th Fronts. In Guaviare, this dissidence has established an alliance with the Urabeños, which handles minor criminal revenue streams, such as those derived from the extortion of businesses and the purchase of cocaine paste.In Putumayo, the 1st Front has made alliances with former members of the FARC 32nd Front, with the objective of expanding into the south of Putumayo, along the border with Ecuador. However, it has come up against groups already firmly entrenched there, such as La Constru and a group which emerged from the demobilization of the FARC's 48th Front.","Its main zones of influence are in the departments of Guaviare, Vaupés, Meta y Guainía.In Guaviare, it controls the municipalities of Calamar, Miraflores and el Retorno; in Vaupés it has a presence in Cararurú and the municipalities of Pocoa and Taraira, while in Guainía it is strongly present in Mapiripana, Morichal Nuevo and Pana Pana, along the Brazilian border.Members of the 1st Front have also been reported in the north of Amazonas department, especially near the border with Vaupés.In Caquetá, it counts with the support of the 7th Front, especially in  San Vicente del Caguán, gracias a alias “Rodrigo Cadete”.In Putumayo, it is focused on Puerto Guzmán and is currently seeking to expand southward along the Ecuador border.","The 1st Front of the ex-FARC Mafia represents the new dynamic of criminal groups in the country: organizations that seek to control criminal economies and territories, and are willing to ally with different kinds of groups to achieve their aims. Moreover, these groups rarely confront the armed forces and the civilian population, and they use state weakness and corruption to hide their actions.This has allowed the 1st Front to position itself better than most criminal groups who have emerged from the FARC demobilization. Its economic strength, criminal alliance and rapid ability to adapt have allowed it to expand into areas which it never previously contested. The vast criminal experience of its leadership is also a major advantage.The 1st Front is arguably the strongest ex-FARC group in Colombia and will likely continue along this path, given its expansion in the south of the country into major drug trafficking areas."
Knights Templar,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/knights-templar-profile/,Knights Templar,,./images/organizations/knights-templar.jpg,2020-05-05,"['knights templar', 'la familia michoacana', 'mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"The Knights Templar (Caballeros Templarios) emerged in March 2011 as a splinter group of the once-mighty Familia Michoacana. Like their predecessors, the Knights Templar cast themselves as a ""self-defense"" movement engaged in a struggle with Mexico's larger criminal cartels on behalf of the Michaocan population, and frequently employ religious imagery in their public communiques.The arrest or killing of several top leaders in 2014 and 2015 has put the criminal organization’s future in doubt, but the group has managed to survive these obstacles and continues to maintain a presence in southern Mexico.","The Knights Templar announced their arrival to Mexico's criminal underworld in March 2011, when they hung banners throughout Michoacan state saying that they would now be carrying out the ""altruistic activities that were previously performed by the Familia Michoacana."" This came after the supposed December 2010 death of Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, alias ""El Chayo,"" the Familia's spiritual leader, and the subsequent announcement that the group was being disbanded. However, it was an ""open secret"" that he was still alive, which was confirmed in March 2014 following his death at the hands of Mexican marines.The group takes its name from a medieval military-religious order charged with defending pilgrims on their journey to the Holy Land, whose members were known both for their piety and for their fearlessness on the battlefield. The name choice is part of the Knights Templar's bid to be seen as more than just a drug gang -- members use Roman warrior-type helmets during induction ceremonies, and distribute propaganda promoting themselves as champions of the fight against “materialism, injustice and tyranny.” The group even announced a temporary ceasefire ahead of Pope Benedict XVI's trip to Mexico in March 2012.The advantage of being situated in Michoacan is that it gives the group power over the major port city of Puerto Lazaro Cardenas. From here, the Knights Templar have access to cocaine shipments from South America as well as methamphetamine precursor chemicals from Asia, which the group either uses or sends north to the border with the United States.However, like the Familia before them, the Knights' power base in Michoacan means that they have relatively little control over the cross-border drug trade. As such, they are forced to negotiate with other cartels in order to move illicit products north.In addition to drug trafficking, the Knights receive a large amount of income from extorting businesses in their areas of influence. This is yet another legacy of the Familia, which at its peak was estimated to have charged ""protection fees"" from 85 percent of legal businesses in Michoacan state. The Knights' extortion activities are aided by its influence over local government officials, achieved through intimidation, and handing over kickbacks from drug profits.In a video appearance in August 2012, a top operative for the Knights, Servando Gomez, alias ""La Tuta,"" described his organization as ""a brotherhood, founded by a set of statutes and codes,"" dedicated to protecting the people of Michoacan from organized crime, and singled out the Zetas as one of the criminal groups ""causing terror"" in the country.At the end of 2012, the Knights welcomed incoming President Enrique Peña Nieto with ""narcomanta"" banners offering to lay down their arms if Peña Nieto kept his campaign promises. However, it was widely derided as not being a serious offer.The killing of the cartel's leader El Chayo and their second-in-command, Enrique ""El Kike"" Plancarte in the span of just a few weeks in March 2014 left the Knights Templar's leadership largely debilitated. Offensives against the cartel -- by vigilante groups as well as state security forces -- has reduced their power and influence in the region. La Tuta took over the cartel's central command until he was captured in February 2015 by Mexican security forces.In June 2017, one of the last alleged leaders of the Knights Templar, Ignacio Rentería Andrade, alias ""El Cenizo,"" was arrested by Mexican security forces in Michoacán.In 2020, the Knights Templar and other sub-factions of the group are still active across southern Mexico in parts of Michoacán and Guerrero, battling against the attempted territorial expansion of groups like the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG).","The Knights were headed by La Tuta, the charismatic leader who frequently used social media to increase his notoriety. However, it is unclear who, if anyone, is waiting in the wings to replace La Tuta since his capture in February 2015. It is unclear who the primary leader of the group was between 2015 and 2017. However, ""El Cenizo"" reportedly had the largest territorial leadership of the group before his arrest.","While they are mostly based in their home turf of Michoacan, the Knights are also active across central Mexico, particularly in the states of Guanajuato, Morelos and Guerrero.Now badly fragmented and splintered into other groups like Los Viagras, it’s not clear that the Knights Templar has any clear leader in 2020.","The Knights have been involved in a bitter conflict with the remnants of the Familia Michoacana. However, more recently the Knights were run out of many cities in Michoacan by self-defense groups, who were backed by government forces. A substantial number of Knights Templar members are believed to have defected to other criminal groups, including the self-defense forces.Splinter factions of the group, especially Los Viagras, are battling powerful groups like the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG) for control of key criminal areas.","The arrests and resignations of several politicians in 2014 with alleged links to La Tuta suggested the Knights Templar sill wield a significant amount of authority in the country's southwest. However, La Tuta's arrest in early 2015 has put the future of the Knights Templar in serious jeopardy.And the arrest of “El Cenizo” in June 2017 solidified the end of any kind of broader regional control the group may have wielded in years past. So far the group has been able to push back against the CJNG’s incursions across the border into Michoacán, but it remains to be seen how much longer remnants of the Knights Templar can withstand this fight. That said, the group’s ability to leverage local communities and governments in the areas where they’re active may help their continued survival.",
Juarez Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/juarez-cartel-profile/,Juárez Cartel,,./images/organizations/juárez-cartel.jpg,2020-07-10,"['juarez cartel', 'mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"The Juárez Cartel is responsible for smuggling tons of narcotics from Mexico into the United States throughout its long and turbulent history, and the group's intense rivalry with the Sinaloa Cartel helped turn Juarez into one of the most violent places in the world.","The Juárez Cartel is one of the oldest and most powerful criminal organizations in Mexico. Since its beginnings, the cartel has focused on drug trafficking, but has expanded into other criminal activities such as human trafficking, kidnapping, local drug distribution and extortion. Based in the city of Juárez in the state of Chihuahua, northern Mexico, the Juárez Cartel is also known as the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization (VCFO), after its leader.The origins of the Juárez Cartel go back to the 1980s, when the Ciudad Juarez area was under Rafael Aguilar Guajardo's control. Aguilar Guajardo worked closely with the Guadalajara Cartel, and after the arrest of the cartel's leader, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, he was granted control of Juárez. Amidst mysterious circumstances, Aguilar Guajardo was killed in Cancún in 1993. His lieutenant, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""El Señor de los Cielos,"" quickly assumed control.The organization grew exponentially under Carrillo Fuentes. More prone to negotiate than fight, Carrillo Fuentes reconstructed Félix Gallardo's old network and more. Eventually, he controlled at least half of all Mexican trafficking and even extended his operations to Central America and into South America, including Chile and Argentina. Carrillo's alias, ""Lord of the Skies,"" aptly described his method: using commercial and parcel traffic, the Juárez Cartel moved thousands of tons of Colombian cocaine into Mexico by air, then into the United States by land. Carrillo Fuentes furthered his reach by establishing his own distribution networks in the U.S. He died, abruptly, in 1997, while getting plastic surgery, leaving behind a well structured cartel but a void at the top.Amado's brothers, Vicente and Rodolfo, took over but a power struggle quickly ensued. After some infighting, the two brothers, and their nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, established a firm command. In 2002, they allied with Juan José Esparragoza Moreno, alias ""El Azul,"" a former member of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police; Ismael Zambada, alias ""El Mayo""; the Beltrán Leyva brothers; and Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Chapo."" Authorities called them the ""Federation,"" but the partnership would not last. After Rodolfo killed two of Guzmán's associates for not paying him to use the Juárez corridor, Guzmán gathered his allies and told them simply that Rodolfo, alias ""El Niño de Oro,"" had to die. Faced with a choice, Guzmán's partners chose him. Rodolfo was killed with his wife as they walked out of a movie theatre in September 2004. Guzmán's brother, Arturo, was killed just a few months later. The war was on, and Mexico still has not recovered.The Juárez Cartel has a large and longstanding transportation, storage and security operation throughout the country. It counts on its ability to co-opt local and state law enforcement, especially the judicial or ministerial police (detectives) and the municipal forces. It has long collected a tax for letting groups use its ""plaza,"" or drug trafficking corridor, and relied on alliances to operate nationwide. But the new modus operandi in the country, that of using small, more sophisticated armies to control swaths of territory, has made it hard for this group to compete. While its two main gangs, La Línea and the Aztecas, are formidable, they have had difficulty keeping pace with their competitors that work for the Sinaloa Cartel. La Línea, which does the street-level enforcement, has been particularly hard hit. Ciudad Juárez saw a decline in murders in 2011, with homicides dropping to a two-year low in May, which some attribute to the diminishing power of La Linea. The enforcement arm, like other failing drug traffickers, may have made an alliance with the Zetas. However, some analysts have suggested that it is the Juárez Cartel which is in decline and La Línea which is ascendant.The Juarez Cartel has also created the Linces, a group made up by approximately 80 deserters from the Army's Special Forces, who are in charge of protecting cartel members and transporting drugs.Today, the Juárez Cartel is still battling rival groups in its traditional stronghold around Ciudad Juárez. More than 1,200 homicides were committed there in 2018 alone, marking the first time the border city had recorded more than 1,000 murders since 2011, when the Juárez and Sinaloa cartels were deadlocked in a bloody war for control of the strategic border town.The current violence is likely driven by the Juárez Cartel’s splinter factions, as well as the local street gangs that such groups use as enforcers and soldiers in order to secure territory for small-scale drug dealing, as well as trafficking larger shipments across the border.In November 2019, the La Línea faction of the Juárez Cartel was linked to the brutal massacre of nine dual US-Mexican citizens from a cross-border Mormon community. The killings put a spotlight on how these so-called “small armies,” or the groups like La Línea that emerged as part of the outsourcing of security by Mexico’s most dominant cartels, have surged to play a critical role in controlling territory for larger groups.","In recent years, the Juárez Cartel has fragmented into smaller splinter factions like La Línea, who appear to play more of a role in controlling territory formerly held by the group.Luis Carlos Vázquez Barragán, alias “El 20,” was leading the faction and allegedly taking direct orders from Carrillo Fuentes before his death, helping the Juárez Cartel move large drug shipments across the US-Mexico border, as well as planning and carrying out targeted assassinations. However, Mexican authorities arrested him in Chihuahua in 2010.Since then, it’s not immediately clear who holds the top position within La Línea’s ranks.","At the height of its power, the cartel operated in nearly 21 states and its main areas of influence included Sinaloa, Durango, Jalisco, Coahuila, Zacatecas, Michoacán, Colima, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Veracruz, Chiapas, Campeche, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Puebla, Morelos and Mexico City.The cartel maintains a firm foothold in Ciudad Juárez and the Valle de Juárez, which remains the key corridor for transporting illegal drugs into the United States. It still has some measure of control over the local and state police, as well as some politicians. It has turned to local gangs to be its enforcers, changing the dynamic in the area and increasing violent confrontation with its rivals.","
Most recently, a bloody battle has resurged in the border state of Chihuahua between the Juárez and Sinaloa cartels, likely over control over key smuggling routes into the United States. A Sinaloa Cartel-linked group known as Los Salazar operating in Sonora state, and the Juárez Cartel-faction known as La Línea operating in Chihuahua state, have been battling each other heavily in recent years.Another group to emerge as of late and test the Juárez Cartel’s control along the border has been the Nuevo Cartel de Juárez. The group has allegedly allied with the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación -- CJNG) and helped them muscle into the area. That said, the Juárez Cartel’s La Línea faction and the Sinaloa Cartel’s Los Salazar faction appear to have far more influence than the newly arrived rivals.","Despite recent news reports about its decline, the Juárez Cartel remains one of the most powerful criminal organizations in Mexico and the region. Small cells carry out different types of operations ranging from transportation to distribution of drugs; street gangs, mostly in the north, act as the enforcement wing and are involved in human trafficking and kidnapping operations.That said, the Juárez Cartel as it was once known is a shadow of its former self. Fragmentation has dogged the group for the past few years, and it seems like the armed wings it developed for security purposes now have more sway in the border regions under the group’s control.",
Tijuana Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/tijuana-cartel-profile/,Tijuana Cartel,,./images/organizations/tijuana-cartel.jpg,2018-02-13,"['mexico', 'mexico groups', 'tijuana cartel']",mexico,"The Tijuana Cartel, also known as the Arellano Félix Organization, is based in one of the most strategically important Mexico border cities for trafficking drugs into the United States. Due to infighting, arrests and the deaths of many top leaders, the organization is a shell of what it was in the 1990s and early 2000s, when it was considered one of Mexico's most potent and violent criminal groups. Still the cartel continues to export narcotics and may be expanding its presence internationally.","The Tijuana Cartel traces its roots back to the western state of Sinaloa. Its founding members were Sinaloans who worked closely with the legendary trafficker Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, alias ""El Padrino,"" who began moving marijuana and heroin into the United States in the 1960s. El Padrino worked with a group of Sinaloans including Pedro Avilés Pérez, Rafael Caro Quintero and Ernesto Fonseca.The group left Sinaloa and formed the Guadalajara Cartel in the late 1970s amid campaigns to eradicate illicit crops, mass arrests and a military offensive in their home state that left Avilés dead. He was replaced by another Sinaloan named Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" who would go on to form the infamous Sinaloa Cartel. The Guadalajara Cartel's other members were also grooming their own replacements. Fonseca’s nephews, Amado and Vicente Carrillo Fuentes, would later create the Juarez Cartel and the Arellano Félix brothers -- Benjamin, Ramón, Francisco Rafael, Francisco Javier, Eduardo (their brothers Luis Fernando and Carlos reportedly did not participate) -- would form the core of the future Tijuana Cartel.After leaving Sinaloa, the Guadalajara Cartel began working with Colombian traffickers, moving large quantities of cocaine. In the early 1980s, a veteran agent of the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) named Enrique Camarena began gathering evidence to prosecute the cartel members. Shortly after helping Mexican authorities destroy a large marijuana field, Camarena was killed by Guadalajara Cartel operatives. The United States began a massive manhunt and pressured Mexico to do the same. Caro Quintero was arrested in April 1985 in Costa Rica, but was released early from prison in Mexico on a technicality in August 2013. El Padrino remained at large for years but was arrested in April 1989.From prison El Padrino divided up his territories. El Chapo and his partner, Héctor Luis Palma Salazar, got parts of Baja California and Sonora; Rafael Aguilar Guajardo would get from Juarez to Nuevo Laredo (the Carrillo Fuentes brothers would later take over this route); and the Arellano Félix brothers would get Tijuana.The brothers looked to expand almost immediately. Shortly after El Padrino's imprisonment, Ramón Arellano Félix killed a close associate of El Chapo in Sinaloa. The fight quickly spread. In May 1993, the Arellano Félix brothers sent gunmen to intercept El Chapo at the Guadalajara airport, striking and killing a Mexican cardinal instead. Francisco Rafael Arellano Félix was arrested by Mexican authorities in 1993, but after El Chapo and Palma were arrested, the Arellano Félix clan grew to unprecedented heights. They made a pact with the Caro Quintero clan in Sonora, the Milenio Cartel in Michoacán, as well as alliances in Colima, Jalisco and Oaxaca that allowed them to dominate the trade from north to south.After El Chapo escaped prison in 2001, a new round of fighting began. In February 2002, Ramón Arellano Félix traveled to Mazatlán to oversee the assassination of Sinaloa Cartel faction leader Ismael Zambada García, alias ""El Mayo."" However El Mayo's men were able to kill Ramón instead. A month later Mexican authorities arrested Benjamin Arellano Félix, leaving Eduardo Arellano Félix and his sister Enedina to lead the Tijuana Cartel. The cartel's leadership continued to suffer arrests and extraditions. Shortly after completing a 10-year prison sentence in Mexico, Francisco Rafael was extradited to the Unite States in 2006, but later released early on good behavior. Mexican authorities captured Francisco Javier in 2006, and Eduardo in 2008.The Tijuana Cartel split after Eduardo's arrest. The founding members' nephew Fernando Sánchez Arellano, alias ""El Ingeniero,"" headed up one faction, while Eduardo Teodoro García Simental, alias ""El Teo"" or ""Tres Letras,"" headed up another. El Teo sought an alliance with the Sinaloa Cartel, while El Ingeniero reportedly allied himself with the Zetas. A bloody feud ensued, but following the arrest of El Teo in January 2010, the organization appeared to consolidate again under El Ingenierio.In December 2012, the last of the arrested Arellano Félix brothers, Eduardo, was extradited to the United States, and was sentenced to 15 years in US prison in August 2013. The oldest brother, Francisco Rafael, was assassinated in October 2013, though he was no longer considered a major player. El Ingeniero was arrested by Mexican authorities in June 2014, leaving his mother Enedina in charge.After around 2010 Tijuana enjoyed a relative peace, attributed to a truce between the Tijuana and Sinaloa Cartels, with Sinaloa retaining primary control of Tijuana and the surrounding area. However, a report in early 2015 indicated the Tijuana Cartel may be attempting to retake territory from Sinaloa. Other reports indicate the Tijuana Cartel may have begun expanding its presence abroad.In 2016, following the re-arrest of El Chapo, evidence emerged that the remnants of the Tijuana Cartel had formed an alliance with the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación - CJNG) seeking to challenge the Sinaloa Cartel’s hegemony in the northern border state of Baja California. Despite the capture of several top suspected members of the Tijuana Cartel since that time, the group appears to retain significant control in the area.","Enedina Arellano Felix, alias ""La Narcomami,"" heads the Tijuana Cartel. Enedina is a sister of the cartel's founding members. Prior to leading the Tijuana Cartel, she reportedly handled much of the organization's finical operations and money laundering.","The Tijuana Cartel primarily operates in its namesake city. Located on the US-Mexico border, Tijuana is a strategic location for smuggling drugs into Southern California.","The Tijuana Cartel is suspected of forming a truce with former rival the Sinaloa Cartel. However, new reports indicate the two cartels may again be competing.","Although the Tijuana Cartel has fallen sharply from the height of its power in the 1990s to early 2000s, the organization continues to exist and is thought to be powerful enough to charge ""piso"" or tax for shipping drugs through areas it controls. The capture of Sinaloa Cartel head El Chapo may allow the Tijuana Cartel to consolidate its control in its home turf, especially in alliance with more powerful groups like the CJNG.",
Gulf Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/gulf-cartel-profile/,Gulf Cartel,,./images/organizations/gulf-cartel.jpg,2020-01-30,"['el coss', 'gulf cartel', 'mexico']",mexico,"The Gulf Cartel is one of the oldest and most powerful of Mexico’s criminal groups but has lost territory and influence in recent years to its rivals, including its former enforcer wing, the Zetas. In the cartel's heyday, its boss, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, was considered the country’s most powerful underworld leader, and the Zetas the most feared gang.","The Gulf Cartel’s origins can be traced to 1984, when Juan Garcia Abrego assumed control of his uncle’s drug trafficking business, then a relatively small-time marijuana and heroin operation. Garcia Abrego brokered a deal with the Cali Cartel, the Colombian mega-structure that was looking for new entry routes into the US market after facing a clampdown on their Caribbean routes by US law enforcement. It was an agreement that, from the business side, proved irresistible both for the Cali Cartel's leaders, the Rodriguez Orejuela brothers, and for the Mexicans: Garcia Abrego would handle cocaine shipments via the Mexican border, taking on all the risks, as well as much as 50 percent of the profits.When Garcia Abrego was arrested and deported to the United States in January 1996, the Gulf Cartel was reportedly pulling in billions in revenues each year, cash that had to be smuggled back across the border in suitcases, jets and through underground tunnels. This drug trafficking organization built a wide-reaching delivery network across the United States, from Houston to Atlanta, New York to Los Angeles, but its influence was most acutely seen in its imitators. Other kingpins, like the head of the Juarez Cartel Amado Carillo Fuentes, alias ""El Señor de los Cielos,"" (Lord of the Skies), quickly followed in Garcia Abrego’s footsteps and began demanding more control over distribution from their Colombian partners instead of settling for a share in the transportation fees. As a result, by the end of the 1990s Mexican traffickers had built a series of cocaine, methamphetamine, and heroin networks that rivaled Cali in size, sophistication and profit. And, by buying out government aides, ministers, the federal police force and even the Attorney General’s Office, the Gulf Cartel was soon rivaling Cali in terms of political corruption.But it took Garcia Abrego’s heir, Osiel Cardenas Guillen, to develop the Gulf Cartel’s military wing in ways never envisioned either in Cali or in Medellin. Cardenas recruited at least 31 former soldiers of Mexico’s Special Forces to act as security enforcers, for at least three times their previous pay. They were expert sharpshooters, were trained in weapons inaccessible to most of their drug-trafficking rivals, capable of rapid deployment operations in almost any environment, and they matched perfectly Cardenas’ more brutal, confrontational leadership style. Cardenas was arrested in 2003, after the US Department of State placed a $2 million reward on his head. But his former protection unit, which soon began operating as an independent group known as the Zetas, is perhaps this group's bloodiest and most influential legacy in Mexico’s drug war.Today, the Gulf Cartel has managed to stick around despite deep internal divisions and ongoing offensives from competing criminal groups to move in on territory under the group’s control in northern Mexico and along the US-Mexico border.","After Cardenas’ extradition to the US in 2007, Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sanchez, alias ""El Coss,"" was believed to be leading the group’s day-to-day operations, until he was captured in September 2012. Cardenas’ brother, Antonio Cardenas Guillen, alias ""Tony Tormenta,"" handled the cartel’s drug trafficking business until he was gunned down in November 2010.The arrest of El Coss left the group without any clear successor. In January 2013, one of the contenders to succeed El Coss, David Salgado, alias ""El Metro 4,"" was murdered by unknown assassins.Mario Ramirez Treviño, alias ""X20,"" a hitman and internal rival of Metro 4, briefly took the organization's top spot following the January murder. He was arrested in Tamaulipas in August 2013 in a Mexican army operation, following the arrest of 24 members of his group a week earlier. He was placed in a Mexican jail, but is also wanted in the United States on drug trafficking and organized crime charges.As with the arrest of previous leadership, his arrest left another power vacuum in the increasingly fragmented cartel.Eventually, Julián Manuel Loisa Salinas, alias “El Comandante Toro,” assumed leadership of the group and commanded a group of hitmen in the border town of Reynosa in the Gulf Cartel’s traditional hub of Tamaulipas. However, Loisa Salinas was gunned down by Mexico’s federal forces in April of 2017. Shortly after that, the Mexican Army captured yet another Gulf Cartel leader, José Antonio Romo López, alias “La Hamburguesa,” in May of that same year, again throwing the leadership of the group into uncertainty.Amid “rapid turnover” in the group’s leaders, José Alfredo Cárdenas Martínez, alias “El Contador” and the nephew of former cartel capo Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, was the only one of the group’s leaders that remained. However, his tenure was also cut short by authorities, who arrested him in early 2018 in Tamaulipas.It’s unclear where exactly the group’s leadership stands now, but alliances with smaller splinter cells and fortifying their traditional bases of operations have allowed the Gulf Cartel to retain a significant place in Mexico’s organized crime landscape.","The cartel’s traditional center of operations is in the northeastern border state of Tamaulipas, with its most important operational bases in Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo and Reynosa. These areas are critical from an operational and a financial standpoint. The cartel makes a substantial amount of money simply charging others for passage through the area.Other key northern cities include Monterrey, in Nuevo Leon, which the cartel lost control of to the Zetas following an intense struggle for control, but appears to be trying to regain. Southwards, the group is known to have established itself in at least 11 other states, as well as in the cities of Miguel Aleman, in Oaxaca, Morelia in Michoacan, and possibly also the Yucatan peninsula.Other key northern cities include Monterrey, in Nuevo Leon, which the cartel lost control of to the Zetas following an intense struggle for control, but appears to be trying to regain. The group also maintains a presence in the states of Nuevo León, San Luis Potosí and Coahuila.","In April 2010, the federal police confirmed that there was an alliance between the Familia Michoacana and the Gulf Cartel against their common rival, the Zetas, which has been pushing aggressively into the Gulf’s traditional stronghold in Tamaulipas.It was little surprise to crime watchers in Mexico. The Gulf has a violent history of seeing former allies turn against it. A previous alliance, brokered in prison between Cardenas and Benjamin Arellano Felix, one of the heads of the Tijuana Cartel, held for about a year until the agreement broke down in 2005, leading to another outbreak of killings in the border states. Another temporary division of territory with the Sinaloa Cartel also broke down in 2007, causing havoc nationwide.Today the Gulf Cartel is still engaged in battles in key northern states with its former enforcement wing Los Zetas, as well as offshoots of the group including the Northeast Cartel.","For a time, the Gulf Cartel faced the Frankenstein-like task of facing down a monster of its own creation in the Zetas. Overall, it appears as though the group has been able to weather the storm. The Zetas are a shadow of their former selves now splintered into several offshoots. For its part, the Gulf Cartel is still in control of a key criminal enclave in Tamaulipas that allows the group to continue trafficking large drug shipments across the US-Mexico border. It seems the cartel’s focus on consolidating power in their traditional strongholds has paid off while other groups battle to expand their operations.",
Familia Michoacana,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/familia-michoacana-mexico-profile/,Familia Michoacana,,./images/organizations/familia-michoacana.jpg,2020-05-05,"['la familia michoacana', 'mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"At the height of its power, the Familia Michoacana’s brutal tactics, strong base of operations and pseudo-religious ideology made it a formidable operation and a point of fascination for outsiders. However, the group has suffered a series of heavy blows, most notably that of leader Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, alias ""El Chayo,"" who was falsely reported killed in 2010 and was later confirmed dead in a shootout in March 2014. The Familia was then largely supplanted by a splinter group known as the Caballeros Templarios (Knights Templar), which has also been seriously weakened in recent years.However, the criminal group is very much still active today. Fragmented cells of the Familia Michoacana are still partaking in drug trafficking, kidnapping and extortion activities in parts of Guerrero state while largely being driven out of Michoacán by remnants of the Knights Templar and other groups. A group known locally as the Nueva Familia Michoacana is also reportedly active in parts of Guerrero and Michoacán, even extorting avocado producers along with other criminal groups trying to take advantage of a key source of illicit profits in the area.","Michoacan has long been home to drug traffickers and drug production, with areas where mostly poorer farmers cultivate marijuana and poppy, the raw material for heroin. A group known as El Milenio, an ally of the Tijuana Cartel, controlled the Michoacan area at the end of the 1990s. But a small group of lieutenants rebelled. There are two versions of what happened next: in the first, the lieutenants reached out to Gulf Cartel to overthrow their bosses; in the second, the Gulf Cartel sent the Zetas in to take over themselves. In either case, by 2003, the Zetas were the new power in the region.The former Milenio lieutenants were trained by the Zetas, who were good teachers but bad landlords. The locals saw them as repressive outsiders, and the resentment increased when the Zetas expanded their business into methamphetamine production. The Familia Michoacana then emerged as a self-styled vigilante group, turning against the Zetas and attacking addicts and dealers of methamphetamine, the drug that is now its biggest moneymaker. The group successfully drove the Zetas from Michoacan and expanded into other states, including Guerrero, Morelos, Guanajuato, Queretaro, Jalisco and Mexico City.The Zetas’ influence upon the Familia -- as well as its splinter group, the Knights Templar -- is still visible, even though it became a mortal enemy of the groups. Like the Zetas, the Familia and their heirs make frequent use of billboard-style messages to communicate with the public, and dramatic violence, the most infamous incident being the dumping of five heads on a dance floor in 2006, the official announcement of the Familia’s existence. The Zetas have responded with propaganda comparing the Familia to “radical Islamists,” driven “crazy by ice” (methamphetamine).The Familia was proudly regionalist and claimed to have won public support in western Michoacan, where in some ways the group, at its peak, acted as the de facto state. It would resolve local disputes, provide employment, and do social work. At times employing the language of political insurgency or of an evangelical crusade, the group won hundreds of recruits in just a few years.When the Familia was at the height of its power, it was one of the most potent, bloody and powerful of Mexico’s criminal organizations, whose activities ranged from drug trafficking and kidnapping to extortion and racketeering. The Familia had international contacts for methamphetamine distribution, including in Holland, India, China and Bulgaria. Criminal groups based in the US, including in major cities like Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles and Atlanta, conspired directly with the Familia for cocaine shipments, a development which surprised investigators, considering the group’s distance from the U.S. border.Proximity to the major port city Lazaro Cardenas gave the Familia access to cocaine shipments from Colombia and precursor chemicals for methamphetamine production from Asia. But the struggle to control the port has proved deadly, and an estimated 1,500 people have died there in relation to disputes with the Familia. Besides drug trafficking, extortion schemes provided the Familia with a reliable source of funds, and, at one point, an estimated 85 percent of licit businesses in Michoacan·were thought to make regular payments to the group.Leader Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, alias ""El Chayo"" or ""El Mas Loco,"" was reported killed in a shootout with police in December 2010 in Apatzingan, Michoacan. In January 2011, following the alleged death of the leader, the Familia announced its intention to ""completely dissolve."" It declared (in the group's typical pious tone) that it sought to end the suffering of the people of Michoacan at the hands of the Federal Police.However, the report of El Chayo's death would later prove to be false, as was rumored for years. On March 9, 2014, government officials confirmed the former Familia leader, who was thought to have subsequently worked on behalf of the Knights, had just been killed in a shootout with security forces in Tumbiscatio, Michoacan. They said fingerprint tests had proven his identity.It seems that Moreno's supposed ""death"" triggered a split between two rival bosses in the group, with Jose de Jesus Mendez, alias ""El Chango,"" allying with La Resistencia. Meanwhile Servando Gomez, alias ""La Tuta,"" formed the Knights Templar, which announced its emergence onto the scene in March 2011 via public banners that said it was replacing the Familia.Indeed, the Knights Templar appear to have won handily against their erstwhile colleagues in the Familia. Mendez, leader of what remained of the Familia, was arrested in June 2011, and told authorities he had been forming an alliance with the hated Zetas -- a move which suggests he was desperate for help against the Knights. In November 2011, it was reported that the government considered the Familia to be all but extinct, with the Knights taking over much of their operations and networks.Today, it’s not clear who is in charge of the renewed La Familia Michoacana, or so-called Nueva Familia Michoacana.","Currently, Hector Garcia, alias ""El Player,"" is believed to control the Familia Michoacana operations in Guerrero and the state of Mexico, although it is unclear how much power the criminal group currently posesses.The Familia Michoacana was previously led by Jose de Jesus Mendez, alias ""El Chango,"" who became the head of the old guard when the Knights Templar splintered off in 2011. El Chango was arrested in June of that year, however, and by November authorities reportedly considered the Familia to be virtually defunct.Even before the group's split , there were thought to be up to three internal factions within the Familia, all juggling partnerships with various cartels -- one reportedly linked to the Sinaloa Cartel, another linked to the Gulf, and yet another with the Beltran Leyva Organization. Other inner divisions were present within the executive council, which was formerly headed by Moreno.Each regional cell reportedly enjoyed a degree of autonomy. While one branch would be dedicated to methamphetamine production, another would extract extortion payments, while another would be made up of hitmen, and so on.","As the Familia Michoacana's name indicates, the group had its base and origins in Michoacan, in particular the mountainous Sierra Madre del Sur. The Familia's powerbase was located in the seven municipalities that make up ""Tierra Caliente"" in southwest Michoacan, about 600 miles from the U.S. border.The Familia also established cells in the states of Guerrero, Morelos, Guanajuato, Colima, Queretaro, Jalisco and Mexico City.The group is most active in 2020 in the states of Michoacán and Guerrero, fight to hold their own against groups like the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación – CJNG) and other smaller armed cells.","After working with the Zetas to overthrow the traditional Michoacan trafficking family, the Valencias, the Familia announced it was working on its own by tossing several severed heads into a nightclub in 2006, an incident that made international news. It later allied with the Sinaloa and Gulf Cartels to fight its progenitors, the Zetas, and to expand into new territory along the U.S.-Mexico border.The Familia also had an infamous ability to corrupt local government officials, in part due to massive profits from methamphetamine production. It enjoyed deep regional loyalties, thanks to social projects like building schools, roads, providing employment through the drug trade, and essentially fulfilling the police’s role in resolving domestic disputes.In the early 2010s, the Familia would become involved in a bitter conflict with successor group the Knights Templar.What’s left of the Familia is now working to fend off incursions from the CJNG and other smaller armed groups in the areas of southern Mexico where the group is still present.","Today’s Familia Michoacana is a shadow of its former self, but hasn’t yet been entirely removed from southern Mexico’s regional criminal landscape, continuing to imbed itself in local communities key for the group’s criminal interests.",
Cachiros,https://insightcrime.org/honduras-organized-crime-news/cachiros-profile/,Cachiros,,./images/organizations/cachiros.jpg,2014-01-21,"['cachiros', 'honduras']",honduras,"The Cachiros were one of Honduras' largest transport groups, with a net worth close to $1 billion. Made up of a family of former cattle rustlers, the organization became a major player in the movement of cocaine between Colombian and Mexican organizations.The group is thought to have bought drugs from Colombian organizations, possibly in Nicaragua, as well in their native Honduras. They then moved the cocaine to the Sinaloa Cartel and other Mexican groups.The Cachiros had large business and political interests that reached to the top of the Honduran elite. They had strong contacts in the military and the police at their service -- particularly in their former stronghold in Colón.The Honduran government had mostly ignored the group until recently. However, the United States government took a special interest in the Cachiros, targeting the group's assets and pushing the Honduran government to seize somewhere between $500 million to $800 million in properties in September 2013. In a deal reportedly negotiated with the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the two leaders of the Cachiros surrendered to US authorities in January 2015, initiating the end of the group's reign.","The Cachiros began as small-time cattle rustlers. Operating along the Olancho–Colón border, the Rivera Maradiaga brothers, apparently with their father's blessing, began stealing and reselling cattle. Their own properties expanded with time, and at some point in the late 1990s or early 2000s, they teamed up with the largest underworld figure in the area, Jorge Anibal Echeverria Ramos, alias ""El Coque.""Coque was well positioned both financially and politically. He dated one of then-Congressman Ramon Lobo's daughters, Margarita. His group was a tight crew in a small town. The oldest Rivera Maradiaga, Javier, dated Coque's sister. For his part, Lobo owns scores of land in the region, although no one has formally linked him to criminal activities.At some point, Coque and the Rivera Maradiaga family had a squabble that turned bloody. The first attempt on Coque's life happened in San Pedro Sula. He survived. The second attempt occurred in Costa Rica. Again, he survived but was subsequently deported to Honduras and jailed. Three days after being imprisoned, he was assassinated.With Coque out of the way, the Cachiros took over. Javier ran the operation. They began running regular shipments from Gracias a Dios to western Honduras or Guatemala, where they would hand off the merchandise to Mexican buyers or their Guatemalan counterparts.The timing was propitious. The Mexicans were taking over more of the distribution chain, channeling their product through the isthmus. Honduras was also going through political turmoil. In 2009, President Manuel Zelaya was removed from power by the military and ushered from the country. The interim government that followed spent most its time dealing with the resulting political upheaval. Drugs flowed freely, and Honduras became a major bridge between the Colombian and Mexican drug trafficking organizations.The Cachiros took advantage, charging between $2,000 and $2,500 per kilo they moved. They also took control of aerial drug routes: a 2013 US Treasury Department Kingpin Designation claimed the group controlled 90 percent of the clandestine airstrips in Honduras. The profits have been enormous, as the 2013 seizures by the Honduran government illustrated.The leaders of the Cachiros are currently in the custody of US authorities. During his trial in New York, Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga accepted his participation in the murder of 78 people, including the anti-drug czar Julián Arístides Gonzáles, former National Security Advisor Alfredo Landaverde and journalist Anibal Barrow. In addition, his statement implicates members of the political and economic elite in drug trafficking and bribery activities. Among those involved are members of the powerful Rosenthal family, the late Honduran tycoon Mauricio Facussé, the brother of the current president of Honduras, Antonio ""Tony"" Hernández, and former President Porfirio Lobo and his son Fabio.And those implicated by Rivera Maradiaga's testimony have started to fall.In July 2017, Yani Rosenthal pleaded guilty in a US federal court to one money-laundering charge as one US attorney said he ""moonlighted as a money launderer for a ruthlessly violent drug trafficking organization known as the Cachiros."" And in August, Yani's cousin, Honduras' former investment minister Yankel Rosenthal, also pleaded guilty in a US court to laundering money for the Cachiros organization. Additionally, Fabio Lobo, the son of former Honduras President Porfirio Lobo, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to conspiring to import cocaine into the United States, was sentenced to 24 years in a US prison for drug trafficking with the Cachiros.Rivera Maradiaga’s 2017 testimony also revealed that the current president’s brother and former congressman, Tony Hernández, accepted $50,000 in bribes from the Cachiros in exchange for the government paying a debt to a company used by the drug cartel to launder money.Tony Hernández was arrested by DEA agents in Miami in November 2018 on charges of drug trafficking. Hernández’s was found guilty in October 2019 after a trial in New York.Another case linked to the Rivera Maradiaga testimony is that of a former regional commander of Honduras' special criminal investigations unit (Dirección Nacional de Investigación Criminal – DNIC), Carlos Alberto Valladares Zuñiga. Valladares was charged in 2018 with having conspired with Los Cachiros to protect the group's drug trafficking activities, eliminated rivals, and recruited police officers to provide logistical support and security.Additionally, former Honduras congressman Midence Oquelí Martínez Turcios has been charged with controlling drugs flowing from Colombia through Honduras and onto Mexico. US authorities have requested Martínez Turcios' extradition.Since the Rivera Maradiaga brothers' trial in 2017, Honduran authorities have continued to seize a number of assets and properties linked to the Cachiros organization and their partners, a sign that investigations into the group's illicit activities may still be ongoing and that additional criminal charges could be brought against new suspects in the future.","The Cachiros were known as a tight-knit, family-run operation, contracting out much of their work to locals, to whom they owed little allegiance and with whom they had little contact; this minimized their risk if any individual cell were to have been compromised.The group's alleged leaders were Javier Eriberto Rivera Maradiaga, alias ""Javier Cachiro,"" and his brother Devis Leonel Rivera Maradiaga.Fears of being killed in Honduras prompted both brothers to turn themselves in to the DEA in January 2015. Javier Rivera pleaded not guilty to drug trafficking charges in February.According to Honduran media reports, the last leader of Los Cachiros, Hernán Natarén, was killed along with his wife in July 2016.","The group operated in the Colón province on the northeastern coast of Honduras. Its territory stretched east to Gracias a Dios, south to Olancho and west to the region's criminal hub, the city of San Pedro Sula.They also had operators in Nicaragua. Contractors received and moved product from the Mosquito Coast through Gracias a Dios and Colon, where it was broken into smaller and smaller shipments as it made its way across the country.","The Cachiros reportedly supplied cocaine and other drugs to Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel and had ties to the Colombian criminal organization the Rastrojos.The group also used gangs to transport some drugs, parceling out the drugs and stuffing them into backpacks to be carried on motorbikes that could more easily avoid military checkpoints by using back roads.","With both leaders imprisoned in the United States, the reign of the Cachiros as a major drug transport group is over. However, with the brothers’ cooperating with US authorities, it is possible that testimony they provide could continue to shed light on networks of elites that aided their group’s activities.In recent years, the testimony of the Rivera Maradiaga brothers have provided a powerful tool against organized crime in Honduras. It has led to a string of connections between Honduras presidents and organized crime, including Manuel Zelaya, Porfirio Lobo and the current president, Juan Orlando Hernández.",
Perrones Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/perrones-profile/,Perrones,,./images/organizations/perrones.jpg,2020-03-10,"['chepe luna', 'el salvador groups', 'perrones cartel']",el,"The Perrones are El Salvador’s most infamous transportation group. Made up of a mix of hoteliers, human smugglers and contraband traders, the group’s activities stretch from Panama to Guatemala. Working from their eastern front, along the border with Honduras, many of them carry dual citizenship with the neighboring country, which allows them to move easily across the porous borders they use to move their products. They appear to answer offers of many suitors, mostly Colombian and Mexican groups but also Guatemalan organizations, that move large quantities of drugs and other contraband north toward the United States and bulk cash south. Many of the Perrones’ leaders have been arrested and charged with various crimes, but the cases against them have fallen apart in El Salvador’s weak justice system.","Many of the Perrones’ bosses got their start smuggling the staples of everyday life into El Salvador from across the border in Honduras. Reynerio Flores, who grew up just a few miles from the border and was one of the gang’s foremost leaders before his arrest, began his career ferrying water into El Salvador by mule. Later, the men who would become the core of Los Perrones expanded into food and clothes, bringing them in not just from Honduras, but from as far south as Panama. Other gang leaders focused on moving contraband cheese, which earned them the nickname El Cartel de los Quesos.Of course, the reward for smuggling cocaine is much higher than for cheese, so the networks shifted focus to where the profits were higher. The logistical requirements for each type of smuggling are largely the same, so Los Perrones were a natural link between the Colombian cocaine producers and the Mexican gangs that became ever more important in the 1990s and 2000s. The Salvadoran networks began to work especially closely with the Sinaloa Cartel, which was also busy establishing itself as the Mexican group most active internationally.Rather than working to create Sicilian style dominance over the territories they control, Los Perrones, known locally as transportistas, are smugglers in the truest sense of the word. They are experts at moving merchandise through El Salvador and across the border into Honduras and Guatemala, for later transit to the Mexico and the United States. Typically, because of the small territory and underdeveloped airway system, they move drugs and other contraband through Central American via trucks.The overland transit comes after they initially collect the cocaine from Colombia and Ecuador, usually via go-fast boats or semi-submersible vessels, both of which can carry large shipments of drugs and are effective at evading authorities on the open sea. The illicit merchandise is typically offloaded onto legitimate-seeming vessels like fishing boats, in which it is brought into the country along the country’s narrow coastline.Their capacity to move merchandise from the open water to Central American highways makes them a valuable ally for the larger Mexican and Colombian gangs running drugs through the region, and they have developed ties with some of the most notorious gangs in the hemisphere, most notably the Sinaloa Cartel. Authorities say that the wealthier and more notorious Mexican gangs represent something of a role model for Los Perrones. In an effort to emulate their senior partners, they have embraced varying elements of Mexican narco-culture, from narcocorridos to a love of thoroughbred horses.Los Perrones also developed deep ties to Salvadoran government as they grew, penetrating local security agencies and political circles in the regions where they operate. The gangs are thought to be particularly close to officials in the eastern portion of the country, where the ARENA and National Conciliation Parties are prominent. In one notorious case, Flores avoided arrest and fled to Honduras after being tipped off by a police officer that his detention was imminent in El Salvador. (He was later arrested in Honduras.)","As a result of the increased attention, as well as infighting among different Perrones factions, many of the group’s original leaders -- Daniel Quezada, Reynerio Flores and Juan Colorado -- have been captured.Additionally, Jose Natividad Luna Pereira, alias ""Chepe Luna"" -- once the Perrones' most powerful leader -- was murdered in June 2014 in Honduras. A police operation in July 2014 also resulted in the capture of Jose Enrique Torres, who was believed to lead a remnant of the organization and work with members of the Barrio 18 gang. It remains to be seen how these events will impact the group's future.","As the group grew, it divided into two geographical subdivisions: Los Perrones Occidentales and Los Perrones Orientales. The former group controls the smuggling cocaine, arms, and migrants from western El Salvador overland into Guatemala. Los Perrones Orientales focus on bringing the cocaine in from South American via maritime routes, and send it over to their allies in western El Salvador or northward to Honduras.Los Perrones have a presence over a wide swathe of El Salvador’s small territory. Los Orientales operate out of cities like San Miguel, Usulutan, and La Union, while the Occidentales are concentrated around the city of Santa Ana.","The relationship between Los Perrones and the other dominant criminal element in El Salvador, the infamous Maras (Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha), seems to be a fluid one. There have been reports of the two groups fighting for control over smuggling routes, but for the most part, the relationship seems to be complementary: with the Maras controlling territory in cities like San Salvador with mass numbers of members, and the Perrones located primarily in more peripheral cities and needing only periodic use of their transportation networks when shipments come through, the two are not constantly at odds. Indeed, Los Perrones often contract groups of Maras as muscle.","While the operated under the radar for many years, Los Perrones began to garner increased attention in the early 2000s, when several tons worth of cocaine shipments linked to the group were discovered in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. As a result of the increased attention, as well as infighting among different Perrones factions, many of the group’s original leaders -- Daniel Quezada, Reynerio Flores and Juan Colorado -- have been captured. In April 2019, Chepe Luna's brother, Ernesto Santos Luna, was sentenced to six years in prison for smuggling contraband. Nonetheless, Los Perrones have regrouped, and remain a major force in the nation’s underworld.",
Barrio 18,https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/barrio-18-profile/,Barrio 18,,./images/organizations/barrio-18.jpg,2021-09-08,"['barrio 18', 'el salvador', 'el salvador groups', 'guatemala', 'honduras']",honduras,"The 18th Street Gang, also known as “Barrio 18,” is one of the largest youth gangs in the Western Hemisphere. Like its better known rival, the Mara Salvatrucha (MS13), the Barrio 18 has cells operating from Central America to Canada, and has a much larger presence than the MS13 in the United States.With thousands of members across hundreds of kilometers, and interests in a number of different illicit activities, Barrio 18 is one of the more significant criminal threats in the region. Still, it is questionable how far its different units are coordinated across borders, or even within the same city.","The Barrio 18 first emerged as a small-time street gang in Los Angeles. While some accounts trace its origins to the late 1950s, the gang began to take its current form in the 1980s after splitting from the Clanton 14 gang. It earned particular notoriety for its role in riots in that city following the acquittal of the police who brutally beat Rodney King, an African-American motorist.Originally, the group’s many cells, known as “cliques,” were the exclusive province of Mexican immigrants in Southern California, and dominated neighborhoods such as MacArthur Park in the Koreatown part of central Los Angeles.However, as other Latino nationalities joined the immigrant population, the Barrio 18 began to recruit members from a variety of backgrounds, a development that would facilitate the group’s spread into other nations, particularly in Central America.Efforts by US law enforcement to slow the gang’s growth have not proved effective. In the late 1990s, a Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) task force, along with local law enforcement, took down some of the Barrio 18’s foremost leaders. However, this did not so much handicap the gang as give them another base from which to operate and recruit new members: federal prisons.Despite efforts to isolate gang leaders from their contacts on the outside and from their fellow prisoners, Barrio 18 bosses like Francisco Martinez, alias “Puppet,” devised ways to continue running criminal activities from the inside. Some Barrio 18 also become members of the Mexican Mafia, the feared prison gang that grouped street gangs in Southern California in a single, powerful collective known as the Sureños. Outside of prison, the street gangs fight one another; inside, they form a single unit under the leadership of the Mafia.Barrio 18 spread south into Central America and Mexico largely as a function of a change to US immigration policies in the mid-1990s, which increased the number of criminal charges for which a foreign-born resident could be deported to their country of origin.The new policy was applied aggressively to gangs in California, where many of Barrio 18’s members were not US citizens. The deportations led to a sudden influx of Barrio 18 members in Central America and Mexico. As a result, some argue that US policy helped Barrio 18 spread internationally.The response of Central American governments to the rise in gang activity has also proven to be largely counterproductive. In the late 90s, beginning in El Salvador, the governments began passing more stringent laws that criminalized mere “association” with gangs. These so-called “mano dura,” or “iron fist,” policies only encouraged the gangs’ growth by concentrating many members in prison, pushing them to reorganize and regroup. In Central America, the space created for extortion rackets and kidnapping gangs by weak police forces and a relatively open criminal landscape was filled in part by the Barrio 18 and the MS13 in the 2000s.What’s more, following a series of violent incidents in prisons between the Barrio 18 and the MS13, Salvadoran officials separated inmates from the two gangs from each other. The leaders increased their control over criminal acts, such as extortion, from inside the prisons.On the outside, they branched into petty drug trafficking. They also began to operate in a more sophisticated manner, laundering money through small businesses such as car washes, and trying to control community and local non-governmental organizations in order to influence policy at the local levels and, later, national levels.Around 2005, the Barrio 18 in El Salvador suffered a rupture between some on the inside of prison and some on the outside. The result of the in-fighting was a split into two factions, the Revolutionaries and Sureños. These factions remain, fighting each other with the same fervor as they do the MS13.The gang poses the greatest threat in Central American nations like El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, where weaker governments and larger gangs (relative to the population) have turned the gang phenomenon into a significant threat to national security — the gangs systematically extort public transport systems, displace entire communities, and have forced their way into the political system.This was most evident in March 2012, Barrio 18 leaders and their rivals in the MS13 agreed to a nationwide “truce,” which was mediated by a government envoy and the Catholic Church and facilitated by the government. As a result of this ceasefire, the homicide rate in the country plummeted.Whereas El Salvador saw about 13 or 14 murders a day in the beginning of that year, this fell to around six a day, on average, in the following months. Following the initial success of the truce, an unsuccessful attempt to emulate it was made in Honduras.The leaders of both the MS13 and Barrio 18 proved alarmingly adept at using their now heightened political profile to their advantage, fueling concerns that the initiative could provide a means of increasing their criminal sophistication and overall influence in the country. To add to these concerns, extortion and disappearances have reportedly continued to rise in El Salvador over the course of the truce, and homicides began rising again in mid-2013 topping out in 2015, before dropping back again.A radical drop-off in El Salvador’s murder rate starting in 2019 has again thrust the country’s gangs into the spotlight. Though state officials attribute the fall to its national security plan, there have been multiple media reports of an informal pact between parts of the El Salvador government and imprisoned gang leaders, with the latter reportedly cooling killings in exchange for better prison conditions.Though the bulk of the alleged negotiations appear to have gone through the MS13, El Salvador media initially detected at least one meeting between government officials and imprisoned Barrio 18 leaders. Additional materials sourced from an unfinished government investigation later provided further evidence of encounters between top officials and imprisoned members of the Barrio 18.The onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 presented both opportunities and economic challenges for the gang. In some parts of Central America, the gang shored up local support by reportedly giving shopkeepers and other extortion victims a temporary reprieve from payments as the initial lockdowns began to bite. But that decision took its toll on rank-and-file gang members in Guatemala, where some strapped-for-cash members purportedly broke off into splinter groups to keep up with extortion rackets, exacerbating the structural weaknesses that have long affected the group.","At the top are “palabreros,” or “leaders,” most of whom are in the prison system. They coordinate all criminal activities. One palabrero keeps a notebook that keeps track of all finances, homicides, drugs, and weapons. There are also palabreros outside the prison system, aka, “en la libre.”Outside, the gang organizes itself in “canchas.” A cancha is a territorial division that isn’t necessarily based on municipal delineations. Each cancha has several “tribus,” or tribes, the smallest units of the Barrio 18 organization.Finally, there are collaborators: those who are not quite or never will be gang members. They help the gang with small jobs, like gathering intelligence, and moving or holding illicit goods.","In Central America, the gang operates mostly in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, where it is estimated to have over 16,000 members. But it is in the United States where it has its most defined presence: an estimated 30,000 to 50,000 members. The group operates in dozens of cities across an estimated 20 states.Many of its members are located in California, but the Barrio 18 also has a presence in other western cities like Denver. Barrio 18 has also had a presence in Italy since the mid-2000s, and in September 2016 the arrest of an alleged Barrio 18 leader hinted at the gangs’ desires to expand their presence in Europe.","The Barrio 18 are fierce enemies with the MS13, and internal divisions among the group periodically flare into violence. The Barrio 18 in El Salvador is divided into rival factions, the Revolutionaries and the Sureños.The gang also has a close relationship with the Mexican Mafia. It is also known to have networks of lawyers, taxi drivers and mechanics as collaborators. The gang’s reliance on extortion and penchant for violence, however, puts it at odds with the local community.",The Barrio 18 has been operational for over 70 years. There is no reason to believe it won’t be around for 70 more.,
Texis Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/texis-cartel-profile/,Texis Cartel,,./images/organizations/texis-cartel.jpg,2017-04-07,"['chepe diablo', 'el salvador', 'el salvador groups', 'texis cartel']",el,"Unlike some Central American gangs that have earned fame for their brutality and their liberal use of violence, the Cartel de Texis has developed a reputation for a more business-like approach to the drug trade. But as the report by Salvadoran news site El Faro about the group illustrates, while the gang isn’t known for leaving a trail of dead behind, it has nonetheless turned itself into one of the more formidable criminal groups in El Salvador, and a vital link for Colombians and Mexicans seeking to move cocaine through the tiny nation.","The Cartel de Texis is traced to three alleged founders: Jose Adan Salazar Umaña, Juan Umaña Samayoa, and Roberto Herrera. More than veterans of the Salvadoran underworld who worked their way up, these men are respected figures in Salvadoran society. From its start, the group has relied less on the frequently brutal tactics of Latin American mafia -- i.e. responding to any slight or business disagreement with bullets and bloodshed -- in favor of more subtle methods, namely bribery and corruption.The leaders of the Cartel de Texis were for the most part well established in the worlds of Salvadoran business and politics long before they began to be linked to the drug trade, dating back to the early 1990s in Salazar’s case. It’s difficult to say exactly how they began running contraband through the mountainous northwest region that connects this Central American nation with Honduras. Yet, according to El Faro, they have been at it for years.To be sure, national authorities have been investigating the group since at least 2000, which suggests that they have been in business far longer. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have also attached an eye to the group, with investigations of some high-ranking members dating back several years. None of the various investigations into Texis personnel, however, have led to convictions of the high-level figures. Many were completely unknown among the general public until the El Faro report, which is a testament to the ability of the Cartel de Texis to operate outside the public eye.Perhaps not surprisingly, in response to the report that summarized the efforts by some elements of the government to investigate this group, Salazar and his cohort were unrepentant and defiant, inviting their critics to prove their links to the drug trade.Since then El Faro has come out with another piece, this time detailing the extensive political influence of the group, especially in the northwest region bordering Guatemala and Honduras.More than any other group, the Cartel de Texis is characterized by a patina of legitimacy. Jose Adan Salazar Umaña is the best example: He is not only the president of Salvadoran soccer’s first division, but also a respected hotelier and one of the nation’s most recognized businessmen. (His business empire also serves as a valuable tool for money laundering, for which he first came under the suspicion of U.S. agencies.) In the Texis leadership circle, he is allegedly joined by Juan Umaña Samayoa, the mayor of Metapan, where the gang’s power structure is centered. Other politicians supporting the Cartel de Texis include Armando Portillo Portillo, the mayor of Texistepeque, a mid-sized city south of Metapan, and Reynaldo Cardoza, a federal congressman from Chalatenango, a city located near the Honduran border.The intimate connections with the highest level of Salvadoran politics has allowed the group to evade the attention of law enforcement. Their political links, which are useful for sweeping those investigations that do exist under the rug, have allowed the Cartel de Texis to branch out into the security agencies, buying off police and soldiers, so as to ensure the integrity of their shipments, as well as judges and prosecutors, so as to further reduce the chances of charges against them. Whereas other Salvadoran gangs like the Perrones and the “maras” have long suffered blows to their upper-echelon leadership, the Cartel de Texis bosses have largely remained immune from government pressure.In April 2017, the group suffered a damaging blow to its leadership after El Salvador's Attorney General's Office arrested José Adán Salazar Umaña, alias ""Chepe Diablo,"" the alleged leader of the Texis Cartel. The arrest further raises questions about links between Salazar Umaña and current Vice President Óscar Ortiz. However, the suspected connections to El Salvador's elites don't stop there. Two additional main suspects, Juan Umaña Samayoa, the mayor of the northwestern town of Metapán, and Wilfredo Guerra, the president of the Gumarsal grain company that has been linked to Chepe Diablo's business network, evaded capture during the operation.","The group is not hierarchical. It is, rather, a circle of leadership and an alliance of convenience, in which each boss has their own chain of subordinates. They collaborate and coordinate as needed, and apparently without a great deal of rancor. In fact, Salazar is said to discourage gang members from even carrying weapons, preferring instead to rely on the protections of those who are legally armed--the police and the military.","The Cartel de Texis' network extends across a northern slice of El Salvador, from the border with Honduras to that of Guatemala. Typically, the cocaine moved by the Cartel de Texis arrives from South America to Honduras by sea via go-fast boats or semi-submersibles to the city of Gracias a Dios, or by plane, in which case they land in the vast farms of the state of Olancho. The Honduran shipment is then transferred into the hands of the Cartel de Texis in San Fernando, a remote border town in northern El Salvador.From there, the shipment cuts an overland path through the northern Salvadoran backwater region, with much of the terrain covered by unpaved roads. It heads first slightly south through the small town of Dulce Nombre de Maria, then west, and finally juts north through the gang’s headquarters of Metapan, crossing the border with Guatemala north of the gang’s home base.This path is known alternately as the Northern Route or as “el Caminito,” the little pathway, and it may soon get even easier to move drugs across it, as the government is moving ahead with plans to pave much of the highways in the region.","The group has an ethos of not subordinating itself before outside groups, but rather serving as perennial free agents. Like their counterparts the Perrones, the Cartel de Texis does business with whoever will pay them to use their network.","The Cartel de Texis has been successful at avoiding the public eye and successful prosecution by authorities for drug trafficking. In response, the Salvadoran attorney general has charged suspected leaders of the group with money laundering and tax evasion. While these moves may be the first cracks in the Cartel de Texis' wall of impunity, the group has yet to suffer significant losses in its leadership or operations.The recent arrest of alleged Texis Cartel leader Chepe Diablo further solidifies longtime suspicions that the criminal group has strong ties with some of El Salvador's most prominent business and political elites. This setback marks the first significant blow the group's leadership and operations have received. However, it remains to be seen what impact Salazar Umaña's arrest will have on the future of the group's operations.",
MS13,https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/mara-salvatrucha-ms-13-profile/,MS13,,./images/organizations/ms13.jpg,2021-09-22,"['el salvador', 'el salvador groups', 'guatemala', 'honduras', 'ms13']",honduras,"The Mara Salvatrucha, or MS13, is perhaps the most notorious street gang in the Western Hemisphere. While it has its origins in the poor, refugee-laden neighborhoods of 1980s Los Angeles, the gang’s reach now spans from Central America to Europe.While they are largely a predatory criminal organization, living mostly from extortion, the gang’s resilience owes to its strong social bonds, which are created and strengthened via acts of violence against mostly their rivals and one another.Their activities have helped make the Northern Triangle — Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras — the most violent place in the world that is not at war. In October 2012, the US Department of the Treasury labeled the group a “transnational criminal organization,” the first such designation for a US street gang, but their criminal proceeds do not even approach those of their counterparts on that list.The US government has since gone one step further, in late 2020 charging over a dozen MS13 leaders in El Salvador with terrorism, marking an unprecedented escalation in the country’s fight against international street gangs.","The MS13 was founded in the poor, marginalized neighborhoods of Los Angeles in the 1980s. As a result of the civil wars wracking El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua, refugees flooded northward. Many of them wound up in California, living among the mostly Mexican neighborhoods of East and Central Los Angeles, as well as the San Fernando Valley.While the Mexican gangs reigned in the local underworld, the war-hardened immigrants quickly organized themselves into competing groups, the strongest of which was called the Mara Salvatrucha Stoners or MSS.The orgins of the name are still disputed, but “mara” is a Central American term for gang. “Salva” refers to El Salvador. “Trucha” is a slang term for “clever” or “sharp.”Salvatruchas was also the name given to the locals who fought against William Walker, an ambitious businessman and proponent of slavery from the United States who tried to subdue various parts of Central America with a small army in the 1850s. Walker, after a brief stint as the self-proclaimed president of Nicaragua, was overrun and executed by Honduran locals.For their part, the Stoners were composed of refugees from El Salvador in the Pico Union neighborhood who spent most of their time listening to heavy metal music, drinking and smoking. With time, the gang evolved, shedding their original Stoner name and image: The MSS became the MS.The gang’s rivals took note. Conflict between the MS and the 18th Street, or Barrio 18, was particularly fierce in and around Los Angeles. The fighting put the gang on the radar of officials who began to jail them in large numbers in the late 1980s and early 1990s.Inside prison, the MS was forced to bow to another master, the Mexican Mafia, or “la eMe” for short, whose power extended from the jails to the streets. The Mafia’s umbrella, known as the “Sureños,” included many prominent gangs and stretched into much of the southwest of the United States and Mexico.The MS13’s subservience afforded the gang more protection in the streets and in prison. In return, the MS provided hitmen and paid the Mafia regular quotas from their criminal proceeds. It also added the number 13, the position M occupies in the alphabet, to their name. Thus, the MS became the MS13.By the mid-1990s, partly as a way to deal with the gangs and partly as a product of the get-tough immigration push toward the end of the presidency of Bill Clinton, the US government began a program of deportation of foreign-born residents convicted of a wide range of crimes. This enhanced deportation policy vastly increased the number of gang members being sent home to El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, and elsewhere.According to one estimate, 20,000 criminals returned to Central America between 2000 and 2004. That trend continues US immigration authorities removed nearly 6,000 suspected gang members in 2018 alone – around 1,300 of them from the MS13.Central American governments, some of the poorest and most ineffective in the Western Hemisphere, were not capable of dealing with the criminal influx, nor were they properly forewarned by US authorities.The convicts, who often had only the scarcest connection to their countries of birth, had little chance of integrating into legitimate society, and they often turned to gang life. In this way, the decision to use immigration policy as an anti-gang tool helped spawn the virulent growth of the gang in Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.The MS13’s principal activities vary a great deal from one region to another. In Central America, where the gang’s reach and size (relative to overall proportions) is largest, the MS13’s operations are more diversified. This includes extortion and controlling the neighborhood petty drug market.Their crimes, such as extorting bus companies, are arguably more disruptive on a daily basis to more people than any other criminal activity in the region. In the United States, the MS13 focuses on local drug sales and “protecting” urban turf to extort small businesses and underground bars.There is some evidence the gang is involved in other, more sophisticated transnational criminal activities, most notably international drug and human trafficking rings. But the gang’s role in these activities appears to be largely in a support rather than a leading role.What’s more, in the more than a dozen international drug trafficking cases tracked by InSight Crime, the gang members worked with networks outside of the MS13 structure, most notably the Mexican Mafia’s networks. In all instances, the drug trafficking was in very small quantities compared to other international criminal groups.Throughout its existence, various governments’ attempts to reduce the threat posed by the MS13 have instead often had the perverse impact of spreading the threat posed by the gang.  Perhaps the most obvious example is the aforementioned policy of deporting foreign nationals committed of crimes in the United States.But Central American governments have also contributed: the “mano dura,” or “iron fist” policies, which jailed youths based on appearance and association as well criminal activities, became the norm following their implementation by Salvadoran President Francisco Flores  in the late 90s. As a result, El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala saw their prison populations overflow with members of the MS13 and other gangs.Because the brittle prison systems in each of those nations was unprepared for the sudden influx of thousands of violent and organized gang members, violence rose sharply inside jails. In response, authorities separated the gangs, but this opened up space for them to reorganize.In prison, for example, they are given a freedom and safety that is no longer possible on the outside. They frequently have access to cellular phones, computers and television. As a result, the MS13’s Central American branches have been able to rebuild their organizational structures from inside prisons walls, as well as expand their capacity to carry out crimes such as car theft, extortion and petty drug dealing.The gang is now in its second generation, and the cycle appears difficult to break. Youth enter as they often see it as their only way through the rising violence around them. Entry is often equally violent, sometimes including a “13-second” beatdown.Older members seeking to break free find internal rules they might have created keeping many of them from separating. The gang, for example, penalizes desertion with a death sentence. Even if they can break free of their membership, their tattoos have often branded them for life.In El Salvador, at least, MS13 members saw something of a reprieve from their usual violent lifestyle since their leaders and their Barrio 18 rivals agreed to a nationwide “truce” brokered through community groups and the Church and facilitated by the government in March 2012. The apparent ceasefire was followed by a tremendous drop in El Salvador’s homicide rate that many hoped would signal a major shift in citizen security in the country.However, some critics of the truce feared it dangerously heightened the profile of the street gangs, and provided them with the resources necessary to exert greater influence on government institutions. The United States was also reluctant to endorse the gang truce, increasing pressure on the MS13 since its implementation.In addition to designating the gang as a transnational criminal organization in fall 2012, the United States imposed economic sanctions on six MS13 leaders by adding them to its Specially Designated Nationals List in June 2013.Concerns over the truce were further fueled by reports of rising extortion and disappearances during the truce period, as well as the discovery of mass graves. Additionally, homicides began rising again in mid-2013 as the truce unraveled, and continued to rise throughout 2014 and early 2015.By 2016 and in the midst of record levels of violence, the government launched a series of “extraordinary measures” to aggressively crack down on the MS13 and the country’s other gangs.The MS13 soon found itself locked in what resembles a low-intensity war with government security forces, with the gangs sustaining the bulk of casualties. The gang has also had to deal with the emergence of anti-gang death squads composed largely of members of the military and police.Violence has since cooled significantly, with homicides plummeting to historic lows in 2019 and 2020 amid allegations of a renewed entente between the MS13 and the El Salvador government. Multiple state officials told InSight Crime there is an informal pact between parts of the government and the gangs, which broadly speaking sees the gangs lower the murder rate in exchange for better prison conditions.Evidence of the alleged pact had surfaced largely thanks to local press, with the El Faro media group publishing prison logs, surveillance photographs, intercepted phone calls and other materials documenting a series of meetings between top state officials and leaders of the MS13. However, the El Salvador government has repeatedly denied the existence of any gang pact.The MS13 also boosted its political capital in El Salvador following the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, in early 2020, reportedly leveraging its vast territorial control and prior relationship with the state to impose curfews, enforce mask-mandates, and run government-financed relief programs in cash-strapped communities where the government has minimal presence.The gang’s domestic exploits may also have helped weather persistent pressure from US prosecutors, who in 2020 began targeting top MS13 leaders in El Salvador with terrorism charges and requesting extraditions. With the extraditions having largely been blocked by El Salvador’s Supreme Court, there has been speculation as to whether MS13 members are being protected as part of the alleged unofficial pact with the government.","On paper, the MS13 has a hierarchy, a language, and a code of conduct. In reality, the gang is loosely organized, with cells across Central America, Mexico and the United States, but without any single recognized leader.The leaders are known as “corredores,” or “runners,” and “palabreros,” loosely translated as “those who have the word.” These leaders control what are known as “cliques,” the cells that operate in specific territories.These cliques have their own leaders and hierarchies. Most cliques have a “primera palabra” and “segunda palabra,” in reference to first and second-in-command. Some cliques are transnational; some fight with others and have more violent reputations. Some cliques control smaller cliques in a given region. They also have treasurers and other small functionary positions.The MS13 also has programs, under which it groups numerous cliques. At its most potent, the MS13 leadership can control the actions of these cliques from afar. This fluid, diffuse structure makes the gang resistant to any single government’s attempt to crack down on it. Arrest the “primera palabra” and the “segunda” quickly assumes control.","Numbers vary, but the US Southern Command says there are as many as 70,000 gang members in the Northern Triangle. The proliferation of gangs has accompanied a rise in murder rates.Of these gangs, the MS13 is the largest in the region. Central American immigration to other parts of the United States, such as New York City and the Washington, DC area, helped foster the spread of the MS13 within the United States as well. The gang has also begun to appear in parts of Europe, most notably Spain and Italy.","The MS13 is enemies with the Barrio 18, another street gang with an extensive presence in Central America, Mexico and the United States. In recent years, the gang has sought to expand its political connections.Video evidence surfaced in 2016 showing that the gang had secretly negotiated with leaders of El Salvador’s governing party, the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (Frente Farabundo Martí para la Liberación Nacional – FMLN), offering them political support in exchange for economic benefits.","The long-term effects of the gang truce in El Salvador continue to unfold, but it appears the MS13 is as strong as ever, and will remain an immense source of citizen insecurity and a potent force.",
FARC,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/farc-profile/,FARC,,./images/organizations/farc.jpg,2022-07-15,"['colombia', 'colombia groups', 'farc']",colombia,"As the biggest irregular army in Colombia, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) have long operated in various regions of the country in search of resources to fund their insurgency. They agreed to end their 52-year war against the government in August 2016, as part of a peace process that began in 2012.The FARC are the oldest and most important guerrilla group in the Western Hemisphere. They have long financed their political and military battle against the Colombian government through kidnapping, extortion and participating in the drug trade on various levels.In spite of a concerted effort by the Colombian government, with over $10 billion in US assistance over the past 15 years, the rebel group still operated in a large proportion of Colombia's 32 departments and is currently estimated to have approximately 8,000 guerrillas in its ranks. Over the decades, the FARC have frequently adapted their tactics in order to survive, from their 1982 decision to begin taxing coca growers and cocaine laboratories, to their failed attempt at establishing a political party, the Patriotic Union (Union Patriótica - UP), in 1984. Following the military defeats suffered during Álvaro Uribe's presidency (2002-2010), and the 2008 death of the FARC's longtime spiritual and military commander, Pedro Antonio Marín, alias ""Manuel Marulanda, the rebel group has focused less on controlling territory and more on guerrilla warfare tactics combined with building up its urban networks and increasing its political outreach.","The FARC's roots can be traced back to the outbreaks of violence that afflicted rural Colombia following the assassination of the populist leader of the Liberal Party, Jorge Eliécer Gaitán, in Bogotá on April 9, 1948. The assassination touched off a sectarian struggle, first in Bogota and later in the countryside, which started out as a battle between the country's two chief parties, the Liberals and Conservatives. Entire villages were targeted for their political affiliations, among them the village of Ceilán, in the Valle del Cauca department, where the Liberal Party recruited young men like Manuel Marulanda, then known by the alias ""Tirofijo,"" to fight off the Conservative paramilitary onslaught. The violence between the Liberal and Conservative parties, which became known as ""La Violencia,"" would leave close to 200,000 dead during the following 15 years. Hundreds of thousands more fled their hometowns for larger cities or more remote rural areas.Among those who fled was a small faction under the control of the Communist Party of Colombia (Partido Comunista de Colombia). These colonists survived during their marches by organizing militias, or what were known as ""self-defense"" units (autodefensas). The Communist Party ""autodefensas"" were part of a larger Colombian communist strategy of ""combining all forms of struggle,"" which also included developing unions and student organizations and vying for political posts. The organization's unity and strategy attracted some members of the Liberal Party's militias, among them Manuel Marulanda, who joined the party some time in the 1950s. The Communist Party's rural factions were tiny but represented an ideological threat to the government, which launched an offensive against their stronghold, the village of Marquetalia, Tolima, in 1964. The offensive cleared the rebels out but provided the spark for the party to formalize its armed group: the Southern Tolima Bloc (Bloque Sur de Tolima).The rebel group adopted the name Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in 1966, and began a slow, steady rise. The growth of the illegal drug market helped. In the mid-1970s, the guerrillas changed their bylaws and began collecting taxes from the numerous marijuana growers in the south of the country. They later expanded that mandate to include coca leaf plantations. During the same period the FARC began kidnapping en masse and extorting large and small businesses. In the early 1980s, the FARC began taxing cocaine laboratories that operated in their areas of influence.The new revenue streams meant better equipment and more troops, but they came with a very high cost. Large cocaine traffickers began balking at the ""taxes;"" they also bought land and began to exert influence on local politics. When leftist rebels from another guerrilla faction kidnapped the daughter of a large drug trafficking organization, several traffickers organized a paramilitary organization, Death to Kidnappers (Muerte a Secuestradores - MAS). There was also fighting between drug traffickers and the FARC over the rebels' alleged theft of a large stash of cash in the Eastern Plains. Farmers, businessmen and small shop owners began to turn on the rebels because of their excessive extortion and kidnapping.In 1984, the FARC tried another tactic and launched a political party while negotiating a peace settlement with the government. The Patriotic Union (Union Patriótica - UP) was small but gained momentum as the country shifted to greater local government control of funds and projects. In its first elections in 1986, the UP won several seats in Congress and its presidential candidate garnered over 300,000 votes, a record for a leftist candidate. In the country's first municipal elections in 1988, the party won 16 mayoral campaigns and another 247 city council posts. The reaction from those who opposed the party was swift. Paramilitary groups and drug traffickers, at times working closely with the Colombian government, assassinated UP members en masse. Over 3,000 were killed in a six-year period, and the FARC returned to the mountains, where they continued their meteoric rise.The guerrillas' growth during this period caused concern, and many questioned the FARC's intentions regarding the UP, wondering whether the rebels had used the party as a means to strengthen themselves militarily even while they negotiated for peace and talked about turning in their weapons. Between 1984 and 1988, the period during which the UP was the strongest, the FARC doubled the size of their forces. This growth was due to many factors, among them the attacks on the UP, which pushed many to give up on the democratic process, as well as the FARC's strategy, which drew from the Communist Party's idea of ""combining all forms of struggle.""This expansion continued apace in the 1990s. After the government launched an aerial assault on the guerrillas' headquarters in 1991, the FARC began spreading their forces throughout the countryside and developed their offensive tactics. In the mid-1990s, the rebels perpetrated a series of spectacular and debilitating assaults on government forces, capturing hundreds of Colombian soldiers and policemen who quickly became bargaining chips in a new round of negotiations with the government. Not long after a prisoner swap between the two sides, the government ceded to the rebels a swath of territory the size of Switzerland in the southern departments of Caquetá and Meta, opening the door to more peace talks.The talks, however, were in trouble from the start when Tirofijo, who had since taken on the formal nom de guerre of ""Manuel Marulanda,"" did not appear at the inauguration. The years that followed included some advances but mostly difficulties. The FARC used the territory to regroup, recruit, train and launch attacks on nearby towns. When the army gave chase, the rebels would retreat to the demilitarized zone. The FARC also held kidnapping victims in the region and oversaw large plantations of coca, the raw material used to make cocaine. In what many saw as a sign of the rebels' real intentions, they built roads and tunnels, as if preparing for the type of prolonged war that Mao Tse-tung had fought in China, or the Vietcong in Vietnam.Those talks ended in 2002 when the FARC hijacked an airplane and landed it along a highway, taking several passengers captive. Fighting broke out immediately as the government sought to retake the land it had ceded for the negotiations. Shortly thereafter, the guerrillas kidnapped Green Party presidential candidate Íngrid Betancourt and her campaign manager, Clara Rojas. In February 2003, an airplane carrying four US government contractors and a Colombian pilot who were doing surveillance over the FARC-controlled region in the south crashed. Three of the contractors were taken captive.These events coincided with the 2002 election of President Álvaro Uribe who, unlike his predecessor Andrés Pastrana, had campaigned on a platform of defeating the guerrillas militarily. The FARC greeted him by launching mortars at the presidential palace during the August, 2002 inauguration.Undeterred, Uribe reinforced the army, strengthened police intelligence, placed security forces in nearly every municipality and created incentive programs for rebels to turn themselves in to the authorities. This effort got a boost from the United States, which had begun an ambitious assistance program in 2000 called ""Plan Colombia."" Following the kidnapping of the three contractors, the US intelligence services upped their training, equipment and assistance to the Colombians, accelerating an already fast-track professionalization program.In 2012, the group entered peace talks with the government of Juan Manuel Santos, and the negotiators announced a bilateral ceasefire deal in June 2016. A final agreement was reached between the two parties in August 2016. The FARC are currently demobilizing in select ""concentration zones"" across Colombia, after which many will be reintegrated into society while those responsible for grave crimes will serve reduced sentences outside of prisons. The points of the accord include tackling drug trafficking and criminal groups, the participation of the FARC in national politics, land reform and victims' rights.Although the FARC have officially withdrawn from their strongholds, not all members complied with the agreement and have instead continued their criminal activities.","The FARC are a complex group with a well-defined structure and line of command. Their organizational structure has evolved throughout the years as a result of a process of adaptation to the main challenges of the internal conflict. Ostensibly hierarchical, the geography and size of Colombia has made it nearly impossible for the central command, known as the Secretariat, to exercise control over the whole organization, which is broken up into fronts. The FARC have a vast support network of logistical experts in bombing, transportation, kidnapping, arms trafficking, food storage, etc., and manages militia groups in the cities. The relative autonomy of the fronts can make them lethal criminal organizations. Indeed, these units, of which there are over 70, have an incentive to thieve, kidnap, extort and plunder, since their growth depends, in part, on how much money they can collect.On the political front, the FARC are connected to the Communist Party of Colombia. Each rebel unit has a political operative, and each soldier has political as well as military duties. These include paying attention to and analyzing the daily news, and spreading the gospel of the FARC to family and friends. For all intents and purposes, the FARC have broken from the Communist Party and, after their own political project with the UP, failed, they have been running two clandestine structures, the Bolivarian Movement and the Clandestine Communist Party of Colombia.In recent years, the Colombian government has dealt several major blows to the guerrilla group's leadership. In September 2007, the Colombian Air Force bombed a FARC camp in the eastern departments of Guaviare, killing the rebel leader Tomás Medina Caracas, alias ""Negro Acacio."" In March 2008, the government bombed a FARC camp located near the Putumayo River, a couple of kilometers inside Ecuador, killing Luis Édgar Devia Silva, alias ""Raúl Reyes"" and several other guerrillas. That same month, Manuel Marulanda died of natural causes.The new leadership of the FARC, Guillermo León Sáenz Vargas, alias ""Alfonso Cano,"" and Víctor Julio Suárez, alias ""Mono Jojoy,"" had been trying to implement a new strategy, but government forces' constant offensives strangled their attempts. Mono Jojoy was killed in September 2010 and Alfonso Cano in November 2011. Several other FARC leaders have taken refuge in Venezuela and other neighboring states. The FARC's maximum leader is currently Rodrigo Londoño Echeverry, alias ""Timochenko,"" a battle-hardened commander whose ideological views were forged not only in Colombia but also in communist Moscow, Tito's Yugoslavia and Cuba.","The FARC have a particularly strong presence in the country's Eastern Plains region near the border with Venezuela and in the southwestern departments of Cauca, Valle del Cauca, and Nariño. The FARC are also present in the western departments of Chocó and Antioquia, among others.","Between 2005 and 2009, the FARC were engaged in a bitter struggle with the smaller guerrilla group National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN). In December 2009, however, guerrilla leaders negotiated a ceasefire and nationwide alliance, and there has since been evidence to suggest the rebel groups have carried out joint attacks and even worked together to extort companies.Similarly, some FARC fronts also collaborate with criminal groups known as BACRIM (from the Spanish for ""criminal bands"") in the drug trade, selling them coca base and cocaine.","In recent years, thousands of guerrillas have voluntarily demobilized, weakening the FARC and building up the state's intelligence on the rebels. The victory that for many seemed within the FARC's grasp at the turn of the century receded into the distance.While the current peace deal has essentially put an end to the FARC's insurgency, its internal conflict is far from over. The guerrillas' exit has led to the criminalization of some dissident elements, spawning groups similar to the BACRIM: the criminal organizations that formed following the demobilization of the country's paramilitary forces.These guerrilla splinter groups have been clashing violently both between themselves and with other armed actors for control over the lucrative criminal economies that the FARC are leaving behind, such as coca cultivations and illegal mining.Some of these former FARC fighters are also transferring to the ELN, bringing weapons, resources and criminal economies with them. This could significantly strengthen the country's second biggest insurgency at a time when it is attempting to forge a peace deal of its own with the Colombian government.",
Rastrojos,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/rastrojos-profile/,Rastrojos,,./images/organizations/rastrojos.jpg,2022-07-20,"['colombia', 'colombia personalities', 'diego rastrojo', 'rastrojos']",colombia,"The Rastrojos are a Colombian criminal group with influence in Norte de Santander, the border department between Colombia and Venezuela. While they were once considered to be the largest criminal organization in Colombia, they are now a small group with a limited territorial presence.The group emerged out of the once powerful Cartel Norte del Valle. The Rastrojos held power over large territories of Colombia, until their main leaders all either surrendered or were captured. The group has since managed to remain in power in a small border area, while larger criminal organizations seek to expel them from the territory once and for all.","The Rastrojos first emerged in 2002 as the armed wing for Wilber Varela, alias ""Jabon,""one of the main leaders of the Norte del Valle Cartel. At the time, Varela was fighting a rival in the Norte del Valle Cartel, Diego Montoya, alias ""Don Diego,"" and Montoya’s private army, the ""Machos.""One of Varela’s lieutenants, Diego Perez Henao, alias ""Diego Rastrojo,"" recruited the first members, and the group took on his name. In addition to providing armed support for the CDNV's internal war, members of the group also protected drug laboratories and key routes for their leader and top lieutenants.Later, in an attempt to enter peace talks between the government and paramilitary groups, the group called itself Rondas Campesinas Populares or Popular Peasant Patrols (RCP). The paramilitaries, under the banner of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC), signed a peace agreement with the government in July 2004, and finished demobilizing their troops in 2006. However, the government did not allow the RCP to participate in the negotiations.Beginning in 2006, the Rastrojos left their traditional center of operations along Colombia's Pacific coast, and started to expand, first towards the coffee region of Quindío, Risaralda, and Caldas, and later towards the border department of La Guajira, in northern Colombia.As the Rastrojos grew, Varela began to lose control. In 2008, he was murdered by Javier Antonio Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" and Diego Rastrojo, after he attempted to prevent them from expanding operations in the northern Colombia departments of Santander and Norte de Santander. Following Varela's death, his former armed wing grew to become one of the most powerful players in the drug trafficking, extortion and kidnapping businesses.From 2006 onwards, the Rastrojos left their traditional hub along the Pacific Coast and began to expand, first into the coffee-growing region of Quindio, Risaralda and Caldas, later into the northern Colombia border department of La Guajira. They eventually had operations in more than a third of Colombia’s 32 provinces.One powerful ally of the group was Daniel Barrera, alias ""El Loco,"" who, along with the Comba brothers and Diego Rastrojo, was part of the Rastrojos' top leadership. Loco Barrera maintained operations in the eastern departments of Meta and Guaviare and was in charge of much of the international trafficking, while Diego Rastrojo commanded the rural Rastrojos.The Comba brothers worked in urban areas such as Cali, running their networks of ""sicarios,"" or assassins. While maintaining their traditional stronghold in Valle del Cauca, the group expanded into neighboring Nariño and Cauca, and deepened alliances with the National Liberation Army (ELN).The group even managed to expand into Antioquia, specifically to the sub-region of Lower Cauca, where, despite the presence of the Urabeños, they managed to control production laboratories and take on key drug trafficking routes to the north of the country.The Rastrojos ended up operating in more than a third of Colombia's 32 departments, with more than 1,500 fighters and controlling almost all cocaine production in the country, becoming the most important criminal group in Colombia.By 2010, the Rastrojos had arguably risen to become Colombia's most powerful criminal group. However, the group collapsed in 2012 with the fall of three of its top leaders. Javier Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" who surrendered to the United States in May 2012, and Diego Perez Henao, alias ""Diego Rastrojo,"" was captured the following month. In September of the same year, Loco Barrera was captured in Venezuela and in October 2012, Comba's brother, Luis Enrique, also handed himself over to US authorities, leaving the group with no clear leader.In further blows to the group, the US Treasury Department placed sanctions on the Rastrojos under the Kingpin Act in early 2013, while one of its former leaders, “Diego Rastrojo” was extradited to the United States on drug trafficking charges that same year.Following these blows to the Rastrojos, it was believed that the group would disappear. However, despite having lost most of its territorial presence and armed capacity by 2013, small cells of the group remained in departments such as Nariño, Cauca, Valle del Cauca and Norte de Santander.This last cell in Norte de Santander managed to lift the Rastrojos from the ashes and regain strengthen, from the resources obtained from drug trafficking, smuggling and other criminal economies in border areas with Venezuela.The resurgence of the Rastrojos attracted the interest of other criminal groups that sought to take territory from them. Since 2015, they have lived an intense struggle with the Urabeños, their enemies of yesteryear, for control of the municipalities of Cúcuta, capital of the department, and Puerto Santander. However, by 2017, the Rastrojos had already declared victory, even expanding their presence to the Venezuelan state of Táchira. But their victory was short lived.Confrontations with the National Liberation Army (ELN) continued in 2020, greatly weakening the Rastrojos. That year, Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Armed Forces (Fuerza Armada Nacional Bolivariana - FANB) also started targeting the group. This brought the Rastrojos to a critical state. From there, the Rastrojos lost their presence in Venezuela and their influence in Norte de Santander diminished considerably.In 2021, in a desperate attempt to maintain its footing, the Rastrojos turned to their former enemies, the Urabeños, for support in the fight against the ELN in Norte de Santander.While they received the reinforcements, the Rastrojos did not fully recover. The group is believed to now only have 60 armed members, and sources in Norte de Santander even mentioned to Insight Crime that the group could become absorbed by the Urabeños.","The Rastrojos’ leadership has been characterized by constant internal divisions.In the beginning, even before the arrests of the group’s original leaders, there were internal disputes between the followers of Los Comba and those of Diego Rastrojo. After the surrenders and captures of these leaders, the group failed to hold a leadership similar to that exercised by the founding commanders.The Rastrojos were internally divided even before the loss of Comba and Diego Rastrojo, due to a split between the followers of Comba and his brothers, and those of Diego Rastrojo. The loss of these bosses has left the group without a clear leader, which has in turn caused it to lose membership.Another internal fracture was evident within the group's leadership in 2019. In March of this year, Wilfrido Torres, alias “Necoclí,” the main leader of the Rastrojos was arrested in Venezuela. After this, Jhon Jairo Durán, alias ""Menor"" one of Necoclí’s subordinates, assumed leadership. However, even from prison, Torres was unwilling to cede power, which triggered a war within the group.The group’s main leader is currently José Gregorio López Carvajal, alias “Becerro.”","The Rastrojos group was a key player in Colombia’s drug trafficking panorama for several years. Initially, they protected laboratories and routes for drug shipments, however, as they consolidated in key territories for criminal economies, they gained greater importance within drug trafficking dynamics that allowed them to establish important relationships nationally and internationally.The group’s ties to Daniel “El Loco” Barrera, propelled them onto Latin America’s criminal chessboard, and even trafficked not only drugs but chemical precursors for the Sinaloa Cartel.Following the arrests of its top leaders, with other surrendering, the group's reach was significantly reduced and with it its involvement in criminal economies. In Norte de Santander,Where they maintain their main criminal enclave, the group collects income from their participation in the drug trafficking chain, smuggling, extortion, and smuggling and trafficking in persons through the so-called trochas, located on the border with Venezuela.","Initially, the Rastrojos stronghold was in the departments of Valle del Cauca and Cauca, along the Pacific coast. In its golden years, the group also had a presence in Antioquia, Bolívar, Cesar, Chocó, Córdoba, Nariño, Norte de Santander, Putumayo, Santander and Valle del Cauca. They even had influence and participated in drug trafficking operations in countries such as Venezuela and Ecuador.Today, the group's dominant presence is concentrated in Norte de Santander, a department bordering Venezuela. However, its presence is getting weaker and weaker.","At the peak of their criminal activity, the Rastrojos differed from other Colombian criminal groups in that they did not necessarily seek to control every part of the drug distribution chain, operating instead via strategic alliances. These alliances included working with rebel groups and former right-wing paramilitaries to move their product.For several years, the Rastrojos had an agreement with the National Liberation Army (ELN) in the provinces of Cauca and Nariño and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in certain other parts of the country. Both these alliances gave the Rastrojos direct access to coca base -- the raw material for cocaine -- at very low prices.The Rastrojos' other main ally, El Loco Barrera, had struck similar agreements with the FARC in some areas prior to his capture in Venezuela in September 2012. Together the Rastrojos and Barrera obtained a huge competitive advantage, one that also led to strong partnerships with Mexican cartels.After the resurgence of the group in Norte de Santander, the Rastrojos maintained an alliance with the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación - EPL), this consisted of non-aggression agreements that provided both groups with access to criminal economies along the border. But that alliance seems to have broken after the certain blows to the Rastrojos.After losing their former ally, the Rastrojos turned to their former enemies, the Urabeños, in 2021, to join forces and confront the ELN in Norte de Santander. While the joint work continues, the Rastrojos remain weak.Despite this, the group has managed to maintain alliances with other criminal actors such as the Tren de Aragua. Both groups are involved in human trafficking on the Colombia-Venezuela border.The Rastrojos have been at odds with the ELN for several years. The ELN has sought to gain territory in key areas for criminal rents in Norte de Santander. This war, along with the blows dealt by the authorities and the FANB, has led the Rastrojos to a critical state. The group may even be on the verge of disappearing.","After the intense blows suffered by the Rastrojos in recent years, the group has lost almost all its armed and territorial capacity. Meanwhile, the Urabeños, their allies, and the ELN, their main enemy, have grown stronger.It is a matter of time before the Rastrojos cease to exist as a criminal group. The remnants of the group could be absorbed by the Urabeños or remain as small franchises that acts under the group's name without maintaining clear unity and a line of command."
ELN,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/eln-profile/,ELN,,./images/organizations/eln.jpg,2022-10-19,"['colombia', 'colombia groups', 'eln', 'venezuela', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"The National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional - ELN) is one of the two main guerrilla armies with left-wing political ideologies operating in Colombia and Venezuela, and one of the most important threats in Latin America.Originally, the ELN was a nationalist movement influenced by the Cuban Revolution and was focused on kidnapping, extortion and attacks on economic infrastructure. While it eschewed drug trafficking for decades, it is now linked to the narcotics trade and has become deeply involved with large drug trafficking organizations.Estimates of the ELN's membership range from 3,000 to 5,000. It is now operational in at least 180 municipalities in Colombia and has militia networks in the country's major cities.It is currently the most powerful criminal group in Colombia and Venezuela, controlling vast areas of coca crops, cocaine production and distribution routes, as well as a heavy involvement in illegal gold mining. Believed to be heavily supported by the Venezuelan regime in exchange for a cut of criminal profits, the ELN has become a fully binational criminal group, operating in both countries freely and controlling much of the criminal economies along the border.","The ELN was formed in the 1960s, just as Colombia was emerging from a bloody, sectarian struggle known as ""La Violencia,"" and numerous religious and student movements -- some of which drew inspiration from the Cuban revolution -- were gaining strength in the country. These two movements would form the core of the guerrilla group from its onset in July 1964, when the small, armed insurgency began training in San Vicente de Chucuri, in the department of Santander. Six months later, on January 7, 1965, the rebels overran Simacota, a small village in Santander, officially announcing their presence.From the beginning, the ELN was a highly ideological outfit, combining its Marxist-Leninist outlook with liberation theology, the religious movement inspired by the Catholic Church's announced shifts in its Vatican II Conference. Some of the group's first recruits came from the church, including Camilo Torres, a popular and outspoken Colombian priest who died in his first battle in 1966. Other priests came from Spain, including Manuel Pérez, alias ""El Cura,"" who was nearly executed during an internal purge by the group's mercurial leader, Fabio Vásquez Castaño, in the 1970s. By that time, the group was reeling, and it was nearly annihilated completely during a 1973 military offensive, known as ""Operation Anorí,"" which left an estimated 135 of its then 200 members dead.Vásquez Castaño was vanquished from the group and Pérez and a former peasant farmer-turned-soldier named Nicolás Rodríguez Bautista, alias ""Gabino,"" took control. Under new leadership, the ELN slowly recuperated, in part because of its increased use of methods it had once condemned, principally kidnapping. During the 1980s, the rebels became specialists in kidnapping and drew much of their revenue from the ransoms. The group also got lucky when several large oil discoveries brought multinational companies into their area of operations. The resulting revenue from both the theft of oil and extortion gave the ELN renewed energy and allowed the group to expand its actions throughout the country.By the mid-1990s, the ELN reached its apex, commanding an army of close to 5,000 soldiers and at least three times that in student, union, and political supporters. It regularly bombed the country's largest oil pipelines, including those that supplied oil from BP's and Occidental Petroleum's fields in the Eastern Plains region, even while it siphoned from the royalties this oil provided the region. It drew revenue from war taxes levied on coca and marijuana growers, particularly in the southern part of the Bolívar department, where the ELN's leadership had established its home base. And, despite Pérez's death in 1998 of hepatitis B, its military actions also became bolder.Once such example is the group's kidnapping of 180 people from a church in Cali, a city in western Colombia, in May 1999. This remainremains the largest mass kidnapping in the country's history. In April of the same year, the group hijacked an Avianca plane with 40 passengers and crew, forced them to land in a remote area, and held them hostage for months.However, internal fighting and the lack of a coherent national strategy left the group vulnerable to attacks by right-wing paramilitary groups and the Colombian armed forces. Beginning in the late-1990s, the group suffered a series of setbacks at the hands of the paramilitaries in its Bolívar stronghold. Desperate, the group teamed up with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) to beat back the attacks but ultimately lost control of the lucrative area. It was the beginning of a decline for the ELN, which steadily lost ground in other parts of the country to both the paramilitary forces and the military.The military setbacks pushed the group to negotiate a settlement with the administration of Álvaro Uribe Vélez between August and December 2002 in Cuba, and later between June 2004 and April 2005 in Mexico. The talks failed, and the government has kept up the military pressure on the ELN ever since. Added to this was lost revenue from dwindling oil production in the Eastern Plains, an ugly and violent feud with the FARC, and chaos among the group's leadership. Some factions of the ELN refused to negotiate with the Uribe administration. Other leaders simply left the group altogether.During this period, the ELN focused on its political activity and on trying to gain some legitimacy with the marginalized communities where the group still had presence.The group has also prospered since the demobilization of the FARC since their peace agreement with the Colombian government. In 2016, when the FARC was abandoning much of its territory, the ELN moved in to take over drug trafficking and contraband, especially in Catatumbo, Norte de Santander and in the northwestern department of Chocó.This gave the ELN greatly increased criminal profits, as well as swelling the manpower and territory of its various Fronts.During this process, the ELN was still engaged in peace talks with the government of Juan Manuel Santos to try and reach a deal similar to the FARC. In September 2017, the two sides signed a ceasefire which ran from October 1 to January 9, 2018. But it was not able to be renewed and no similar ceasefire has been signed since.In April 2018, the government of Ecuador stopped being a guarantor of the peace process after the kidnapping and murder of three Ecuadorean journalists by an armed group along the Colombia-Ecuador border. The talks then moved to Havana, Cuba, where Colombia’s peace negotiations with the FARC had taken place.This unstable situation has grown more volatile since Colombia’s President Iván Duque came to power in August 2018, as he returned to aggressive policies against criminal groups.In January 2019, the ELN attacked a police training school in Bogotá with a car bomb, killing 21 people. As a result, Duque froze all peace talks and asked the Cuban government to send home all ELN representatives on the island. Cuba did not follow this request but a number of ELN leaders, Nicolás Rodríguez Bautista, alias “Gabino,” and Israel Ramírez Pineda, alias “Pablo Beltrán,” have been stuck in Havana, Cuba, ever since.On October 25, 2020, a joint operation by military and police in the municipality of Nóvita, in the northern department of Chocó, led to the killing of Andrés Felipe Vanegas Londoño, alias “Uriel,"" a charismatic and well-known ELN commander within its Western War Front.In October 2021, the ELN carried out a series of attacks on Ecopetrol oil infrastructure in Colombia, which it said were meant to ""open a debate"" about the state's use of oil resources. Attacks on oil pipelines are an old modus-operandi for the ELN, which it used liberally during the 1990s, especially in Santander and other regions of Colombia's Eastern Plains.In late 2021 and early 2022, the ELN has faced a series of assaults on its positions in Venezuela's Apure state and Colombia's Arauca department by ex-FARC Mafia forces, principally the 10th Front and 28th Front, leaving dozens dead and hundreds displaced. While the ELN is believed to outgun the ex-FARC Mafia, the dissident fronts have been cavalier in taking the fight to the larger group in its Colombia stronghold of Arauca.","The main decision-making body of the ELN is the Central Command (Comando Central - COCE), composed of five commanders. Directly below this is the National Directorate (Dirección Nacional - DINAL), where 23 representatives from each War Front sit. Following this comes the eight War Fronts, the main fighting structures, which are made up of a commander, a political leader, and a military leader.Currently, Eliécer Erlinto Chamorro, alias ""Antonio García,"" is the commander-in-chief of the guerrilla group.He is followed by Israel Ramírez Pineda, alias “Pablo Beltran,” who leads the ELN delegation to peace talks with the government and is in charge of political matters and recruitment. Jaime Galvis Rivera, alias ""Ariel,"" oversees the group's financial matters, while Gustavo Aníbal Giraldo, alias “Pablito,” manages the relationships between the COCE and the various distinct War Fronts.Pablito, who is known for his belligerence, orchestrated the car bomb attack in Bogotá in 2019 that resulted in the end of the peace talks. He has also played a central role in the ELN's evolution into a bi-national group, using his relationship and knowledge of  the department of Arauca, on Colombia's border with the Venezuela and its eastern state of Apure.Added to the highest levels of leadership is the group's eight War Fronts. The ELN’s horizontal structure allows each Front to operate and take actions independently. These are:- The Northeastern War Front Manuel Pérez Martinez (Guerra Nororiental Manuel Pérez Martínez -FGNO), which operates in the department of Norte de Santander and the state of Zulia, Venezuela.- The Northern War Front (Frente de Guerra Norte - FGN) which operates in the departments of La Guajira, Cesar, Magdalena, and Atlántico.- The Manuel Vásquez Castaño Eastern War Front (Frente de Guerra Oriental Manuel Vásquez Castaño – FGO) in the departments of Chocó and Risaralda.- The Jesús Darío Ramírez Castro War Front (Frente de Guerra Jesús Darío Ramírez Castro - FGJDR) with influence in the department of Antioquia and southern Bolívar- The Central War Front (FGC) with influence in the departments of Tolima and Risaralda.- The Omar Gomez Western War Front (Frente de Guerra Occidental Omar Gomez - FGO) in the departments of Chocó and Risaralda.- The Carlos Alberto Troches Zuleta Southwestern War Front (Frente de Guerra Suroccidental Carlos Alberto Troches Zuleta - FGSO) in the departments of Nariño and Cauca.- The Camilo Torres Restrepo National Urban War Front (Frente de Guerra Urbano Nacional Camilo Torres Restrepo - FGUN), with a presence in the country’s main cities such as Medellín, Barranquilla, Bogotá, Popayán, Neiva, Cúcuta, Villa del Rosario, Bucaramanga, Barrancabermeja, Ibagué, and Cali.All of these War Fronts are subdivided into smaller groups, sometimes also referring to themselves as fronts, with more localized power bases.","The ELN currently operates in at least 23 of Colombia's 32 departmentsThe main ELN strongholds are the departments of Choco, in the northwest of the country; Bolivar, in the center; Norte de Santander, in the northeast; and Arauca, in the east of the country. In these regions, the ELN control parts of the drug trafficking, contraband smuggling, and extortion economies.To a lesser extent, but with strategic importance, the group is in the departments of Antioquia, Cesar, Cauca, Valle del Cauca, Nariño, and Vichada. These departments are key for their coca crops, cocaine production, or smuggling routes to Ecuador and Venezuela.The border with Venezuela has become the most important region for the ELN. The main war fronts there are the North Eastern and Manuel Vásquez Castaño Eastern War Front, which have strengthened their presence inside Venezuela in recent years, reaching at least seven states within that country.InSight Crime has documented that the ELN has made incursions into states such as Anzoátegui, Bolívar, and Guárico, in the center and south of the country.","The ELN has had multiple allies and enemies over its dozens of years in operation. These relationships are often determined by local or sub-regional interests of the War Fronts rather than a national policy of enmity towards a particular group.In Antioquia, the group has been fighting the Urabeños, also known as the Gulf Clan (Clan del Golfo) and the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia – AGC) since 2019. Another enemy are the Caparros, a small criminal structure operational in Colombia’s Antioquia and Córdoba departments, who are also known as the Virgilio Peralta Arenas Front and the Caparrapos.The guerrillas have also been fighting the Urabeños for years in Choco, in western Colombia, a department that is key to the movement of drugs to the Pacific Ocean and the smuggling of migrants to Panama. In the midst of this war, the ELN has made alliances with small groups in the urban centers of Choco and Antioquia, with the aim of receiving intelligence and an armed wing in these areas. In exchange, these groups receive supervision and support from the larger player.One actor that was once an ally of the ELN is the 10th Front of the ex-FARC Mafia. It is now the guerrillas' main enemy on Colombia's border with Venezuela.In 2019, the groups were reported to have made non-aggression agreements in the Arauca, Boyacá, and Casanare departments. However, in 2022, animosity between the ELN's 10th Front and Domingo Laín Front reignited in Arauca and the state of Apure, Venezuela. The conflict continued until the end of the year.During the same period, the group went from battling with the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL) in Norte de Santander and Cesar, two departments on the border with Venezuela, to become one of the main groups in the area, controlling cocaine production points.Another unexpected ELN ally is the ex-FARC ""Segunda Marquetalia,"" led by Luciano Marín Arango, alias ""Iván Márquez"". Since 2018, high commanders of both groups have met in Venezuela, where they have discussed a strategy for criminal expansion in South America, among other aims.Finally, some security elements in Venezuela are also strategic alllies of the ELN. These relationships have allowed the guerrillas to strengthen rapidly on the Venezuelan side of the border.","Today, the ELN is today one of the main criminal groups in Colombia and Venezuela. Its strength poses  new challenges for any eventual demobilization and calls into question the ability of the Colombian government to defeat the guerrilla group..The ELN and the government of President Gustavo Petro began a new round of peace talks in November 2022.These talks face several obstacles. First, is the ELN's horizontal structure that gives each War Front  certain independence and creates the room for eventual disarmament orders from the COCE to be refused by members.In addition, the guerrilla group is at a historic moment. With a force of up to 5,000 members, controls an extensive network of criminal rents throughout Colombia, and has leaders who, like Pablito or Ariel, seem more interested in economic opportunities of continued criminality than in reaching a political agreement for peace.As such, the future of the peace talks is undoubtedly in the hands of the ELN. There is a long way to go before an agreement will be reached. The guerrilla group will undoubtedly continue strengthening itself as talks go on, as they have done in the past.Finally, there is the ELN's binational character. In Venezuela, the ELN now operates with certain freedoms thanks to its relations with politicians and security forces. The ELN groups operating in Colombia appear to have different interests and behaviours than those operation in Venezuela, and the distance between these two stances could lead to problems in reaching concensus.At present, it appears most likely that the ELN will continue to be the most important binational group in the north of the region, and that it will grow stronger in Colombia and Venezuela regardless of the peace talks with Gustavo Petro's government. However, the rapid strengthening of the guerrilla group may create rifts among their leaders, particularly between those not in the same country. The risk of losing internal cohesion is therefore a real possibility.",
AUC,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/auc-profile/,Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC,,./images/organizations/autodefensas-unidas-de-colombia---auc.jpg,2015-11-17,"['auc', 'colombia groups']",colombia,"The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) was a coalition of right-wing death squads that used the conflict to camouflage their illicit economic activities. These included drug trafficking, displacement, kidnapping, and extortion. The AUC once operated in two-thirds of the country with approximately 30,000 soldiers.","The origins of the paramilitaries go back to the early 1980s, when drug traffickers, facing a wave of kidnappings by leftist guerrilla groups, decided to create a death squad they called Death to Kidnappers (Muerte a Secuestradores - MAS). This illegal group assassinated not just the kidnappers, but also any supposed member of the rebels' infrastructure, which included many innocent civilians, activists, union leaders and politicians. Later, ""self-defense"" groups emerged, some of them initiated by Colombian army officers and politicians who called for the population to organize in their own defense. Many of them were legally constituted. However, rather than protect civilians from the transgressions of the guerrillas, many of the groups simply worked for drug traffickers, at the behest of large landholders, or both. The alliance with these powerful economic interests gave paramilitary groups access to weapons, cars and communications equipment, but it distorted their original purpose.Indeed, the rise of the drug traffickers' economic power would change the face of the conflict. Powerful members of the Medellin Cartel invested heavily in land and, using the paramilitary groups, sought to shield themselves from the guerrillas' extortion and kidnapping attempts. MAS expanded exponentially in these rural areas. But soon the ""self-defense"" groups were protecting drug stashes and cargoes rather than civilians. These organizations also unleashed waves of violence against sectors of the population who were considered supporters of the guerrillas. Thousands of civilians were killed, including state agents and politicians, leading the government to criminalize the paramilitary groups.The criminalization of these groups coincided with a larger battle over extradition fought by the Medellin Cartel and its leader Pablo Escobar against the government. This fight eventually spread to other parts of his organization. When Escobar killed two of their close associates, Fidel Castaño and his brothers, Carlos and Vicente, teamed with Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" to form a group called People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar (Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar - PEPES). They used Carlos as their intermediary with the police, who worked closely with the paramilitary group to gun Escobar down in December 1993. Fidel mysteriously disappeared shortly thereafter. One story is that he died fighting the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular de Liberacion - EPL). Another is that Carlos killed him in a family dispute. In either case, the core of the paramilitary group that he and Don Berna had created remained.The second generation of paramilitaries came from the PEPES. The remnants of this group formed the Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Cordoba and Uraba (Autodefensas de Cordoba y Uraba - ACCU). In 1996, the ACCU created a loose federation of self-defense groups comprised of seven regional organizations known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). These paramilitary groups were able to establish local fiefdoms in the main areas of guerrilla influence and drive out the rural population that they accused of collaborating with the rebels.The AUC's emergence coincided with a shift in the drug trafficking industry. Following the destruction of the Medellin Cartel and the subsequent dissolution of the Cali Cartel, the market became segmented, giving rise to about 500 small micro-trafficking groups. Leftist guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) also began exerting more territorial control over areas where drug crops were harvested and drugs were produced. The result was near-inevitable conflict between the two remaining super-structures as the paramilitaries fought the guerrillas for control of the means of production of the drug crops, entering by force -- often with the support and assistance of the Colombian army -- and carrying out selective assassinations and massacres that generated massive displacement and widespread terror.The profits from their war spoils allowed the AUC to grow exponentially and create an army of more than 30,000 soldiers. But the source of this profit, principally drugs, placed the group in the crosshairs of the United States government, which sought to break up what had become arguably the largest drug trafficking organization in the world. Sensing a showdown and already facing a series of indictments in the US for drug trafficking, the paramilitaries sought a way out by negotiating a peace deal with the Colombian government.In 2020, InSight Crime published a new investigation, revealing how Guillermo León Acevedo Giraldo, alias ""Memo Fantasma,"" a former member of the AUC had been living in luxury in Madrid, Spain. He was arrested in June 2021.","The Castaño brothers are considered the founders of Colombia's paramilitary movement, but each of the regional groups that comprised the AUC also had its own leadership.","At the height of its power, the AUC operated in two-thirds of Colombia, with a particularly strong presence in the Caribbean Coast region, especially in Uraba, a region located in northwestern Colombia near the Panamanian border.","The AUC fought against the FARC for control of areas that were strategic in the drug trade, and targeted communities it believed to be loyal to the FARC, perpetrating massacres and other atrocities. At the same time, the AUC counted on the support of military and political officials.","Between 2003 and 2006, the AUC and the Colombian government hammered out a peace agreement, and numerous paramilitary fronts demobilized. The shortcomings of the process, however, were immediately apparent. The government lacked the infrastructure to verify who the demobilized paramilitaries were and whether they had turned in all their weapons. Some paramilitary groups deliberately duped the government, handing in old and poorly maintained weapons and conscripting civilians to pose as paramilitary soldiers.These groups began operating under new names even before the demobilizations officially ended in 2006. The new groups -- now referred to as ""criminal bands"" or BACRIMs, for the Spanish acronym -- include the Urabeños, the Rastrojos, ERPAC, the Paisas, the Machos, Aguilas Negras, and Renacer, among others. These groups are now dedicated to drug trafficking and organized crime, as well as attacks on civilians, especially activists and community leaders.For many Colombians, the peace process and the AUC's demobilization did not improve their situation. While more than 30,000 paramilitaries demobilized, many remained at large or abandoned the process and have since been implicated in grave human rights violations, drug trafficking, extortion, kidnappings and many other criminal acts.The paramilitaries' legacy extends beyond security. AUC members infiltrated the state and political parties, which has led to a series of investigations -- in which prominent legislators have been charged -- that have revealed what is known as the ""parapolitics"" scandal. The tradition of corruption continues to undermine and demoralize the Colombian government, and remains an integral factor in the ongoing violence in the country.",
Urabeños,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/urabenos-profile/,Urabeños - Gulf Clan,,./images/organizations/urabeños---gulf-clan.jpg,2022-11-08,"['colombia groups', 'colombia mafia', 'gaitanistas']",colombia,"The Urabeños, also known as the Gulf Clan (Clan del Golfo) and the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia – AGC), emerged from the ashes of Colombia’s paramilitary movement to become the dominant criminal force in Colombia, with a reach that spread across the country. However, under pressure from authorities, the hold that leadership has over local cells that form this national network is getting weaker, and the group stands on the precipice of splintering into independent factions.This process may only be further accelerated by the capture in October 2021 of the group's leader, Dairo Antonio Úsuga, alias “Otoniel,” by security forces in northern Colombia. While his control had been slipping for a few years under the pressure of a sustained manhunt, he remained an identifiable leader for the group, and his removal may trigger further fragmentation.","The Urabeños take their name from Urabá, a northwestern region of Colombia near the Panamanian border highly prized by drug traffickers as it offers access to the Caribbean and Pacific coasts from the departments of Antioquia and Chocó. The group also refers to itself as the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia – AGC) and are called the Gulf Clan (Clan del Golfo) by the Colombian government.The Urabeños' origins can be traced to notorious paramilitary warlord Vicente Castaño, who in 2006 broke away from the demobilization process of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia – AUC), and rearmed a paramilitary unit with two of his lieutenants: the former commander of the AUC’s Calima Bloc, Ever Veloza Garcia, alias “HH,” and Daniel Rendón Herrera, alias “Don Mario,” the former finance chief of one of the wealthiest paramilitary factions, the Centauros Bloc.When Castaño was killed in March 2007, most likely after having been betrayed by HH, Don Mario inherited the network, and set to work recruiting former paramilitary fighters in Urabá, where his brother, Fredy, alias “El Aleman,” had commanded the AUC’s 2,000-strong Elmer Cardenas Bloc.Don Mario quickly assembled a fighting force of around 80 men and then monopolized this important drug route, taxing traffickers for every kilogram of cocaine that passed through his territory. By 2008, Don Mario was one of the richest and most-wanted traffickers in Colombia. He began to expand his empire, moving into southern Córdoba province, the Bajo Cauca region in northern Antioquia, and into Medellín, and the Urabeños soon clashed with rivals such as the Paisas, the Rastrojos and the Oficina de Envigado. Police blamed Don Mario’s organization for at least 3,000 homicides between 2007 and 2009.Don Mario was captured on a farm in rural Urabá in April 2009 by a team of 200 police commandos. Following his capture, the Urabeños fell under the control of Juan de Dios Úsuga, alias “Giovanni,” and Dario Antonio Úsuga, alias “Otoniel,” two brothers who had begun their underworld careers with the now demobilized guerrillas of the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL) before passing into the ranks of the AUC.The Úsuga brothers gathered other former EPL guerrillas turned paramilitaries, who formed the disciplined and capable military core of the Urabeños, the “Estado Mayor,” or board of directors. They launched a new expansion plan by sending trusted lieutenants from Urabá to take control of strategic drug trafficking real estate, preferably through alliances and agreements, but otherwise through violence.In January 2012, Giovanni, the mastermind of the Urabeños strategy, was killed during a police raid on a ranch in the department of Chocó, leaving Otoniel as the maximum leader. Despite this setback, the Urabeños expansion continued, and when the leader of their principal rivals, the Rastrojos, surrounded to the authorities in mid-2012, the path was clear for the group to become Colombia’s dominant criminal organization.The Urabeños' influence spread across the country, and soon the group controlled drug production zones, trafficking corridors and international dispatch points throughout north Colombia, along both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and along the land border with Venezuela.To facilitate this expansion, the Urabeños also developed a new model of organized crime. While some of its cells were directly controlled, in other cases the group absorbed local criminal organizations into its network, which operated as semi-autonomous members of the Urabeños “franchise.”In 2015, the government launched a major offensive against the Urabeños known as ""Operation Agamemnon."" While the initial phase of the operation saw seizures of multi-ton shipments of cocaine and millions of dollars in assets, and the arrests of hundreds of Urabeños members -- its principal targets -- the Urabeños leadership, remained elusive.However, this began to change in phase two of Agamemnon, and in 2017 the Urabeños command nodes began to fall. In May, security forces captured Eduardo Ortiz Tuberquia, alias “El Indio.” In August, they killed Otoniel’s second-in-command, Roberto Vargas Gutiérrez, alias “Gavilán,” and then in November, they killed military boss Luis Orlando Padierma, alias “Inglaterra.” That same year, Colombian police stated that Agamemnon had dismantled ""half"" of the Urabeños, although that number is hard to quantify.With the pressure mounting, and following two years of tentative approaches, in September 2017, Otoniel offered to turn himself in and demobilize the Urabeños, even appearing in a public video appealing to the Colombian government.That offer was refused and Agememnon was expanded to a taskforce of 3,000 men in 2018. This maintained pressure certainly weakened Otoniel's control, who saw his closest advisors captured and killed, and his family targeted.
His brother, sister and cousin were all arrested and extradited to the United States between 2019 and 2021.After years of being on the run, Otoniel was captured in October 2021, in an operation in which involved more than 100 police officers and 500 soldiers. In May 2022, he was extradited to the United States and charged in New York for conspiring to manufacture cocaine and distribute it to the US. He pled not guilty.A day after he was extradited, the Urabeños carried out a show of strength across Colombia across 11 Colombian departments and 180 municipalities throughout the country. This display of force saw curfews imposed on villages, blockades across major highways, and left 24 civilians dead.In late 2022, the Urabeños indicated their willingness to participate in the Total Peace (Paz Total) plan put forward by Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, although it is uncertain if all of its disparate groups and factions would do so.","The Urabeños are primarily dedicated to transnational drug trafficking. Members of the leadership group are themselves international traffickers that manage their own routes. However, the network as a whole is less a drug cartel and more a service provider to independent drug traffickers. The group controls territories and regulates or runs the coca base market, escorting shipments along international trafficking corridors, ensuring access to or protection for processing laboratories, and providing storage and dispatch services in coastal and border regions.The Urabeños network model requires local cells to be financially self-sufficient. As a result, these groups have expanded into illegal mining, extortion and microtrafficking, and they run or take a cut of other criminal activities that take place in their territories.Amid underworld shake-ups in the wake of the demobilization of the FARC, Otoniel’s Urabeños have become embroiled in bitter turf wars with the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) guerrilla and ex-FARC Mafia groups.In 2020 and 2021, the group also became involved, albeit in a limited manner, in the ongoing scramble for cross-border criminal economies between Colombia and Venezuela, reportedly reaching some sort of alliance with their old enemies, the Rastrojos, to fight the ELN there. Their impact inside Venezuela, compared to the ELN or ex-FARC Mafia, has remained somewhat limited, however. Since this evolution happened in the final months of Otoniel's freedom, it is uncertain how much sway he had on this development.They also maintain a longstanding relationship with Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia, created in the AUC days, which regularly moves large shipments of cocaine across the Atlantic.","The Urabeños established a mixed network model, in which approximately one-third of local cells were directly commanded by the leadership in Urabá, while the others were local criminal organizations that used the Urabeños name and were expected to provide services or follow strategic orders when called upon. The network is coordinated by a national command node based in their stronghold of Urabá, consisting of former EPL guerrillas-turned-paramilitaries that is led by Otoniel. However, this command node has been devastated by recent security forces operations, leaving Otoniel an increasingly isolated figure largely concentrated on his own survival.Otoniel was captured in northern Colombia in October 2021 and subsequently extradited to the United States.Following his extradition, the leadership of the Urabeños passed to Jovanis de Jesús Ávila Villadiego, alias ""Chiquito Malo.""Born in the Urabeños' heartland of Urabá, Chiquito Malo is a safe pair of hands after the blow that was Otoniel's capture. A former paramilitary member of the AUC until their demobilization in 2004, he was commander of the Urabá Central Structure, by which time he controlled the Urabeños' drug trafficking activities in the Gulf of Urabá, a key territory for shipping drugs to Central America and the United States.By 2015, he was considered to be one of the group's top leaders. In June of that year, the United States government issued a formal accusation, identifying him as one of the main leaders of the drug trafficking structure.When he ascended to the top position in 2021, there were doubts as to whether he could keep the Urabeños united. But so far, the group appears more resistant to fragmentation than previously thought.","The Urabeños franchise has a presence in at least 17 of Colombia’s departments, as well as internationally. The group's base and territorial stronghold is centered around the Gulf of Urabá in the departments of Antioquia and Chocó, and stretching into Córdoba. They have an extensive presence throughout the rest of these departments, as well as along the Caribbean coast, in the city of Medellín and in departments such as La Guajira, Santander, Valle del Cauca and Norte de Santander.The group also has a small presence in an around Cúcuta along the Venezuelan border.","The competition for territory sparked by the demobilization of the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) has pitted the Urabeños against the smaller guerrilla group the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN). In the department of Chocó in particular, the rivals are involved in a bitter and bloody turf war.The new mafia forming from FARC remnants, meanwhile, has the potential to create both new allies and enemies, depending on whether the two sides perceive it to be in their interests to cooperate or compete for the territory left behind by the guerrillas. In some areas, notably Córdoba in the north, the Urabeños are reportedly working with ex-FARC mafia, while in others, such as parts of Antioquia they are violently clashing with them.Furthermore, in early 2018, there were signs of local criminal groups previously part of the Urabeños violently rebelling against the central command, raising the possibility of new enemies emerging from within the network. This may be linked to rumors that the Urabeños high command has been unable to pay some of its members due to security force operations and cash flow problems.In 2020 and 2021, it was reported that the group had made an alliance with its old enemies, the Rastrojos, to fight back against both the ELN and the ex-FARC Mafia at the Colombia-Venezuela border.The Urabeños’ drug trafficking operations has also seen the group build alliances with independent drug traffickers within Colombia and Mexican drug trafficking groups like the Sinaloa Cartel.In 2022, the group expressed its desire to be part of the Total Peace proposal tabled by President Gustavo Petro.","The leadership node that has coordinated the network from Urabá is almost certainly done following the arrest of Otoniel. His capture was followed by the arrests and deaths of numerous other leaders, some of which even surrendered. The breakup of the Urabeños model of a central leadership node coordinating dispersed factions and semi-independent local franchises now seems inevitable.However, no matter what happens to its leadership, the Urabeños cells on the ground will not disappear. They will continue to control key strategic criminal territories, offering services to drug traffickers and other criminal elites, and running their own localized criminal activities. Some may operate as the private armies of the Urabeños drug traffickers that currently head certain fronts, whereas others may become independent networks with leaders from within the local ranks.It remains to be seen whether the group, and how many of its franchises and sub-groups, will eventually take part in negotiations with Gustavo Petro's government."
Norte del Valle Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/norte-del-valle-cartel-profile/,Norte del Valle Cartel,,./images/organizations/norte-del-valle-cartel.jpg,2015-11-17,['norte del valle'],,"The Norte del Valle Cartel (NDVC) emerged out of the breakup of the infamous Cali Cartel to became the wealthiest and most powerful Colombian drug trafficking organization of its day. However, for much of its lifespan the group was wracked by paranoia, divisions and treachery, and in its later years operated more as a network of competing factions than a coherent and cohesive group. The protracted dissolution of the cartel that began in 2007 gave rise to several newly independent criminal organizations, including the Rastrojos, which would go on to become one of the most influential of Colombia's next generation of drug trafficking organizations. According to FBI estimates, at its peak the cartel was responsible for 60 percent of the cocaine reaching the United States.","The NDVC originated from the fractured trafficking networks left behind when the leaders of the Cali Cartel negotiated their surrender to the authorities in the early 1990s. Many of its first members were former police officers and had close ties to the security forces.Initially, the organization was principally led by former policeman Orlando Henao Montoya, alias ""El Hombre del Overol"" (""The Man in Overalls""). Henao surrendered to the Colombian authorities in 1997, but continued to operate from prison and launched attacks against the remnants of the Cali Cartel and NDVC associates who were cooperating with the US authorities. In 1998, Henao was murdered in prison in retaliation for a hit on Cali Cartel chief Helmer Pacho Herrera, supposedly due to concerns that he was cooperating with the DEA.The cartel reorganized around Wilber Varela, alias ""Jabon"" -- another ex-policeman who had been in charge of the organization's assassins -- with the support of Lorena Henao Montoya, the sister of Henao and then-wife of imprisoned NDVC leader Ivan Urdinola, alias ""El Enano"" (the Dwarf).However, the organization began to fracture as Jabon and his allies were challenged by a faction led by Diego Montoya Sanchez, alias Don Diego. In 2002, the paranoia that had hung over the cartel since the reintroduction of extradition for drug traffickers reached feverish levels, leading to a permanent rupture. By that time several leaders had been indicted by the United States and some had begun to think about cutting deals. Tensions reached a breaking point when one of Don Diego's main allies, Victor Patiño Fomeque, alias ""El Quimico,"" met with DEA agents to negotiate his surrender. By some accounts, he was instead arrested and extradited to the US where he began to cooperate with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).Soon after, another Don Diego ally, Miguel Solano, began informing on his associates to the DEA. When Jabon found out, he had Solano killed. Don Diego, who had also been considering turning himself in, was apparently unaware Solano had been snitching and retaliated, launching a full scale war between the factions.The split led to a bloody conflict as the leaders pitted the military wings of their operations -- Jabon's Rastrojos and Don Diego's Machos -- against each other. The conflict claimed an estimated 1,000 lives between 2003 and 2004 alone, and even went on to inspire a Colombian TV show ""El Cartel de los Sapos"" (""The Cartel of the Snitches""). The mafia war soon encroached on Colombia's civil war as Don Diego reportedly allied himself with the leftist guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) -- while Jabon turned to the guerrillas' enemies in the right-wing paramilitary umbrella group, the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (the AUC). Jabon's Rastrojos even attempted to participate in the AUC demobilization between 2004 and 2006, changing their name to Popular Peasant Patrols (Rondas Campesinas Populares - RCP) in an attempt to portray themselves as a paramilitary unit and take advantage of the benefits being offered to the AUC.The beginning of the end for the NDVC was sparked by the capture of Don Diego in 2007. Any sense of victory for his rival Jabon was short lived, as he was killed in 2008 in a hit ordered by his deputy, Luis Enrique Calle Serna, alias ""Comba,"" who went on to assume control of the newly independent Rastrojos. However, the conflict unleashed by Don Diego and Jabon continues today, as the Rastrojos, weakened but still powerful, continue to dispute Valle del Cauca territory with the remnants of the Machos, who now fight alongside neo-paramilitary group the Urabeños.The rest of the NDVC's leadership soon followed Jabon and Don Diego and, by the end of the decade virtually the whole of the cartel's leadership structure had been extradited or murdered.","By 2010, essentially all of the cartel's leaders were either killed or extradited.","The Norte del Valle Cartel was primarily based in the northern part of Valle del Cauca, a western province of Colombia that includes the city of Cali and the port of Buenaventura -- a key dispatch point for drugs leaving the country for the United States.","The NDVC worked with Mexican criminal groups such as the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) to transit cocaine to the United States. The cartel's leadership also established close links to the paramilitaries of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). According to the US Department of Justice, the cartel employed the AUC to guard its cocaine laboratories and distribution routes and provide personal security for cartel members and associates.However, brutal infighting between the factions of the cartel's military wings left an estimated 1,000 members dead between 2003 and 2004.Like its predecessor the Cali cartel, the NDVC maintained a far-reaching network of corruption that infiltrated all levels of Colombia's institutions, including the security forces, prosecutors, intelligence agencies, judges, and politicians. The cartel also maintained a web of informants that would keep members informed of the movements and plans of enemies in rival organizations and the security forces.","Although the NDVC's leadership structure has effectively been dismantled, the cartel's legacy lives on. Aside from the still feuding Rastrojos and Machos, former NDVC operators, including the now returned El Quimico, continue to be influential figures in the Valle del Cauca underworld while others reportedly operate from other countries such as Bolivia and Argentina.The cartel's operations have also helped establish a number of trafficking routes that are still in use today, especially the use of high-speed and fishing boats to take cocaine shipments from Colombia's Pacific coast to Mexico, where they would be collected by Mexican allies, principally the Beltran Leyva Organization -- the former armed wing of the Sinaloa Cartel -- who moved it on to the United States. In 2005, the DEA estimated the cartel had exported over 500 tons of cocaine -- worth over $10 billion dollars -- by this route since 1990.",
Red Command,https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/red-command-profile/,Red Command,,./images/organizations/red-command.jpg,2022-07-17,"['brazil groups', 'red command']",brazil,"The Red Command (Comando Vermelho) is Brazil’s oldest criminal group, created in a Rio de Janeiro prison in the 1970s as a self-protection group for prisoners. It started out with low-level crimes like muggings and bank robberies, but in the 1980s the group moved into the cocaine trade, working with Colombian drug cartels and taking on a social leadership role in many of Rio’s marginalized neighborhoods.It has since grown into a sizeable national and transnational threat. While still maintaining its power base in poorer neighborhoods around Rio de Janeiro, it has a major influence in prisons across the country, with the northern region of Amazonas and western state of Mato Grosso being its secondary strongholds. It also has a foothold inside Bolivia, from where it sources much of its cocaine. Its clashes with the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital - PCC) and Family of the North (Familia do Norte - FDN) are a regular source of violence. Since 2020, it has also had to fend off repeated incursions and massacres by state forces and by militia groups into Rio favelas under its control.","The Red Command was born out of an alliance between common criminals and leftist militants, when the two groups were thrown together in prisons under the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985. The terrible conditions in Candido Mendes prison, on Ilha Grande island in Rio de Janeiro, pushed inmates to band together in order to survive within the system. They first formed a left-wing militia organization called the “Falange Vermelho,” or “Red Phalanx,” but the ideology was soon abandoned as the group became more deeply involved with organized crime, and was dubbed “Red Command” by the press.By 1979, the group had spread out of the prison and into Rio’s streets. Members who were on the outside were tasked with providing money to those on the inside through criminal activities such as bank robbery, allowing them to maintain a decent quality of life in prison and to finance escape attempts.The ideas of the Red Command spread to other prisons, and the power of the organization grew. Two decades later, in São Paulo, a similar prisoners’ movement would emerge — the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC).The Red Command was ideally placed to partner with Colombian cartels when the cocaine trade began to boom in the 1980s, as it had the structure and organization to reliably obtain and distribute large quantities of the drug. Members on the outside now had a clear objective: forming well-armed gangs to take over drug turf in the name of the Command. It gained control of many poor neighborhoods in Rio de Janeiro that had been neglected by the state, setting up a parallel system of government inside the favelas and providing employment to inhabitants long excluded from Brazilian society.By the 1990s, the city’s all-powerful illegal gambling bosses, known as ""bicheiros,"" saw their influence diminish, paving the way for the Red Command to become Rio’s top organized crime group and build up its presence in other states.In 2005, the Red Command was thought to control more than half of Rio de Janeiro’s most violent areas, though this fell to under 40 percent by 2008. A police pacification program intended to bring a state presence to criminally-dominated areas may have further reduced the group’s influence in the early 2010s, but the security strategy’s long-term effects were limited.The Red Command is thought to have maintained links to the now largely demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC). Red Command leader Luiz Fernando da Costa, alias “Fernandinho Beira-Mar,” was arrested in Colombia in 2001 while allegedly exchanging weapons for cocaine with the guerrillas.At the end of 2016, a breakdown in a longstanding alliance between the Red Command and the PCC generated a wave of violence in Brazilian prisons. Over the following year, the conflict between the two groups continued as the PCC sought to reduce the power of the Red Command by forming alliances with enemy gangs as well as co-opting Red Command members with the aim of assuming control over drug trafficking in the group's traditional zones of influence.","The Red Command has a relatively loose leadership structure, and has been described as a network of independent actors, rather than a strict hierarchical organization headed by a single leader.However, there are prominent bosses within the structure, including Luiz Fernando da Costa, alias “Fernandinho Beira-Mar,” who is currently imprisoned, and Isaias da Costa Rodrigues, alias “Isaias do Borel,” who was in prison for more than 20 years until his release in 2012.In December 2014, authorities in Paraguay arrested a top Red Command leader, Luis Claudio Machado, alias “Marreta.”Fernandinho Beira-Mar has maintained strong influence within the group despite being in jail for life and police have continued to target his legacy. In January 2022, a raid killed Lindomar Gregório de Lucena, alias ""Babuino,"" the Red Command's alleged leader in Rio de Janeiro and Beira-Mar's reported foster son.","The Red Command is based in Rio de Janeiro, but has a presence in other parts of Brazil, including São Paulo. It is particularly strong in the northern state of Amazonas and the western state of Mato Grosso, while also operating in Paraguay and Bolivia.","The Red Command worked closely with the PCC, until the groups' longstanding alliance was broken in 2016.In addition to the PCC, the Red Command's main enemies are militias composed of active and former security force officers and the Rio-based criminal groups Amigos dos Amigos and the Pure Third Command (Terceiro Comando Puro – TCP), a breakaway faction of the Third Command (Terceiro Comando), which was set up by dissident former Red Command members.The Red Command maintained an alliance with the Family of the North (Família do Norte – FDN), a powerful crime group based in the Amazon metropolis of Manaus, between 2015 and early 2018, when the two groups broke off their cooperation over internal disputes. In 2020, this alliance was definitely shattered when the Red Command attacked the FDN in Manaus, leading to hundreds of deaths. The result was the Red Command becoming the dominant drug trafficking group in Brazil's Amazonas.A rising preoccupation for the Red Command is the rate at which favelas under its control in Rio de Janeiro have been targeted for violent police raids. A study in 2021 found that Red Command neighborhoods saw four times the number of security operations than those under militia control, according to the Intercept. The loss of territory to the militias could become a real threat to the group's territorial control in Rio.The Red Command is thought to have links to Colombia’s demobilized FARC rebels, and maintains ties with other networks trafficking cocaine from the Andes region as well as marijuana from Paraguay.","The Red Command underwent a rough period after the end of its alliance with the PCC. Its now-enemy formed an alliance with Amigos dos Amigos to contest the Red Command's territorial control in Rio de Janeiro. However, the Red Command overcame these challenges, relegating Amigos dos Amigos to a second-tier gang in the city.While still far smaller than the PCC, the CV was estimated to have around 30,000 members around Brazil in 2020. Having taken over much of the drug trafficking infrastructure in Manaus from the FDN, and with a growing presence in the northeast of Brazil, it is now in a strong position to continue trafficking tons of cocaine from Bolivia and Paraguay.Of more pressing concern are the repeated raids and massacres of dozens of people in favelas under CV control in Rio de Janeiro. These coordinated campaigns to weaken the group may also directly be benefiting rival militia groups.",
First Capital Command - PCC,https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/first-capital-command-pcc-profile/,First Capital Command - PCC,,./images/organizations/first-capital-command---pcc.jpg,2020-03-09,"['brazil', 'brazil groups', 'pcc']",brazil,"The First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC) was inspired by the Red Command (Comando Vermelho). Both criminal organizations were formed by prisoners as self-protection groups in Brazil's brutal prison system. The PCC arose in São Paulo in the 1990s and has forged a bloody path to dominance throughout the country. The group, now the largest and best-organized criminal organization in Brazil, is believed to have members in all of the country’s states, and has expanded its operations internationally to neighboring South American nations in addition to Europe and Asia.","The PCC formed in the wake of the October 1992 massacre in São Paulo’s Carandiru prison, in which Brazilian security forces killed over 100 prisoners following a riot. In August 1993, a group of eight prisoners who had been transferred to Taubaté prison formed the PCC to fight for justice for the massacre and to push for better prison conditions. They expressed solidarity with another prison-based gang, the Red Command, adopting its slogan ""peace, justice, freedom,"" and advocated for revolution and the destruction of the capitalist system.The PCC's existence was first publicly reported by journalist Fatima Souza in 1997, although the São Paulo government continued to deny that there was any such group.In 1999 the group carried out the biggest bank heist in São Paulo's history, stealing some $32 million.In subsequent years, the government moved to split up the PCC's leaders, transferring them to prisons across the country. However, this allowed the gang to forge stronger links with other crime groups and to spread its ideas more widely.It had become impossible to deny the PCC’s existence by 2001, when it coordinated the biggest prison rebellion the world had ever seen, with simultaneous shutdowns in 29 facilities across São Paulo state.In 2006, the PCC launched an even more significant rebellion in protest after the transfer of members to remote facilities. Imprisoned members took over more than 70 prisons across the country, holding visitors hostage. Simultaneously, the group launched coordinated attacks on the outside focused on São Paulo that left more than 150 dead.Over the next decade, the PCC grew in strength and sophistication, aided by a virtually unimpeded ability to conduct business in Brazil’s under-resourced prisons as well as a reported truce with the São Paulo police. In the early 2010s, the group began branching out to establish drug and arms trafficking operations in neighboring countries like Bolivia and Paraguay.In late 2012, São Paulo’s public security secretary was forced to resign after a spate of violent clashes between police and the PCC, reportedly in response to authorities ramping up actions against the gang in violation of the spirit of the truce.During the early 2010s, the PCC also made attempts to influence politics in its home state of São Paulo. And with increasing recruitment and revenues, the gang began to emerge as the most powerful criminal organization in Brazil.Boasting more than 11,000 members across much of Brazil, and with multimillion-dollar monthly revenues, the PCC expanded its criminal portfolio to include large-scale international drug trafficking operations. The group developed ties with the powerful Italian mafia, the ‘Ndrangheta, and began laundering money in foreign countries like China.In the latter half of the decade, the PCC grew bolder in its use of violence. The group was blamed for a series of armed robberies in Paraguay in 2015. And in early 2016, a video surfaced on the internet depicting the decapitation of a teenager, reportedly linked to a dispute between the PCC and its erstwhile ally, the First Catarinense Group (Primeiro Grupo da Catarinense – PGC).In late 2016, the PCC broke a longstanding truce with the Red Command, setting off months of bloody prison riots that led to hundreds of deaths. Authorities linked the violence to clashes between the two groups over control of lucrative drug trafficking routes running through the remote northern Amazon region of Brazil. Reports also suggested that the PCC was seeking to challenge the Red Command in its home city of Rio de Janeiro, and that the PCC was fending off challenges from a rival group in São Paulo state, contributing to a spike in violence there.In 2017, the PCC appeared to move into expansion mode. The group was linked to international drug shipments traveling through Uruguay, kidnappings and robberies in Bolivia, and attempts to recruit dissident members of the demobilizing Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC).The PCC was also blamed for a spate of murders reportedly linked to conflict over the drug trade in Paraguay. And in April 2017, the gang reportedly carried out the biggest armed robbery in Paraguay’s history.The fallout from the breakdown of the PCC-Red Command truce continued to generate violence in early 2018, with the PCC seemingly undeterred in its ongoing campaign of domestic and international expansion.","The PCC organizes itself with strong independent local leadership working through a franchise system instead of being dependant on a vertical hierarchy. However, dues are collected from members of the organization and are used to pay lawyers, buy off prison guards and police, and to purchase drugs and weapons. A 2018 report from Brazil's Federal Police described the gang as being run at the highest level by a group of powerful regional leaders, many of whom are incarcerated.Two founding members of the PCC, Jose Marcio Felicio, alias ""Geleião,"" and César Augusto Roriz da Silva, alias ""Cesinha,"" were expelled from the organization in 2002, and founded a rival organization, the Third Capital Command (Terceiro Comando da Capital — TCC).According to the Brazilian police, Marcos Willians Herbas Camacho, alias ""Marcola,"" serves as the group's maximum leader, operating from prison where he is serving a two-decade drug trafficking sentence. The group’s second-in-command, Abel Pacheco, alias “Vida Loka,” is in jail while facing trial for murder charges.The PCC lost several top leaders in late 2017 and early 2018. High-ranking PCC leader Edison Borges Nogueira, alias “Birosca,” was killed in a São Paulo prison in December 2017, after being expelled from the group earlier in the year as a result of a fight between his wife and other prisoners’ family members on a bus. Rogério Jeremias de Simone, alias “Gegê do Mangue,” allegedly the PCC’s third-in-command, and Fabiano Alves de Souza, alias “Paca,” another top leader, were killed in February 2018 in a suspected clash with a rival group.","The PCC is based in São Paulo, Brazil’s most populous and economically important state, though it maintains a presence around the country. In recent years, the PCC has expanded its activities internationally, developing operations in nearly every country in South America in addition to establishing ties with European crime groups. Paraguay has also become an important stronghold for the Brazilian organization.","A 20-year truce between the PCC and Brazil's other dominant criminal organization, the Red Command, broke down in late 2016, resulting in a rapid grab for territory and allies by both sides.To shore up support in the northern territories, which are home to important drug trafficking routes, the PCC allied with a local crime group known as the Guardians of the State (Guardiões do Estado – GDE).In late 2016, the PCC provided material support to the Friend of Friends (Amigo dos Amigos - ADA) in their developing war against the Red Command in Rio de Janeiro. Reports also suggest the PCC may be seeking to co-opt other Rio-based rivals of the Red Command in an attempt to challenge the group on its home turf.","The PCC's ambitions are not limited to the domestic environment. Its recent spread throughout the region has resulted in it filling a void in countries where no homegrown criminal organization has taken charge.With the Brazilian economy currently facing an ongoing crisis, the underfunded security apparatus is continuously playing catch up with the PCC. The group’s power and influence, combined with its strong transnational presence, suggest that it could attain the upper hand in the struggle against the Red Command.",
Tren del Llano,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/train-of-the-plain/,Tren del Llano,,./images/organizations/tren-del-llano.jpg,2022-06-23,"['megabandas', 'venezuela', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"Tren del Llano (Train of the Plain) is one of the first so-called ""megabandas"" or criminal gangs to develop in Venezuela. The criminal enterprise is active in drug trafficking, extortion, kidnapping and murder and was known both as ""El Tren de Llano"" and ""El Picure,"" the street name of its formidable founder José Antonio Tovar Colina, one of Venezuela’s most wanted criminals until he was killed by the Bolivarian National Guard in May 2016.Since November 2021, the group has been actively persecuted by the Venezuelan authorities and its continued survival is in doubt.","Tovar began his criminal life in the state of Guárico as a small-time car thief and drug trafficker. The origins of his gang, Tren del Llano, can be traced back to 2008, where it began as a small-scale criminal enterprise limited to stealing cars from local farms in the central state of Guárico and northeastern state of Aragua.The original 10 members of Tren del Llano are thought to have first met in prison, a common trend in the formation of ""megabandas,"" although it isn’t clear from reports on the gang whether Tovar did time in jail before forming the group. Another twenty core members joined up on the streets.Sociologist Luis Cedeño, director of the Venezuelan Observatory of Organized Crime (Observatorio Venezolano del Delito Organizado), says ""megabandas"" tend to replicate  the structures and codes of the prison world on the streets.In Venezuela’s penitentiaries, prison bosses called ""pranes"" control smaller criminal groups called ""carros,"" or ""cars."" If a prison boss amasses several cars, then his group is considered a train, explaining why the names of various megabandas in Venezuela include the word ""tren.""In July 2013, Tovar appeared on authorities' radar after he killed Renny Jesús Mejías, a detective from the investigative police (CICPC). By that time, Tren del Llano had expanded to kidnappings and killings along with drug trafficking, and it was heavily armed. The group began to pose a significant threat to the Venezuelan state, and launched numerous attacks on security forces, often using grenades and high-caliber weapons. The increasing size and criminal activity carried out by the group placed Tovar in the crosshairs of the Bolivarian National Guard (GNB), the CICPC and, eventually, Interpol.The gang is responsible for the kidnapping and robbery of the vice-minister of Indigenous Communities of Concha de Mango, in Guárico, and the deaths of five people at a party in Valle de la Pascua, the assassination of two police officials in Aragua and the robbery of multiple vehicles and uniforms from a local plant belonging to PDVSA, the state-owned oil company (Petroleos de Venezuela).Among the most violent acts came in November 2014, when Tren del Llano massacred 11 people on a farm in Aragua during a confrontation with a smaller rival gang  called “Memo.” Memo was posing as Tren del Llano while attempting to extort farmers. Although 11 bodies were found, authorities say it is possible that Tren del Llano removed several bodies from the crime scene.Tovar's gang reportedly created rural squads that specialized in extortion to directly target local farmers and businesses. By the end of 2015, CICPC voiced concerns that the growing megabanda was potentially gaining territory close to Caracas. As a result of Tren del Llano consolidating power and carrying out escalating acts of intimidation against locals and police officials, the investigation headed by the CICPC intensified and Tovar became one of the most wanted criminals in Venezuela.On May 3, 2016, the National Guard launched an operation to catch him. The confrontation with the police on the streets of Tovar's home neighborhood and operations' base, El Sombrero, in Julián Mellado, Guárico, resulted in his death.Tovar’s death left the group severely weakened. After several years of more discreet operations, a faction of Tren del Llano re-entered the public eye in July 2019 when a video went viral of alleged members shooting their weapons in the air in Altagracia de Orituco, Guárico, in homage to two murdered peers. Subsequent police operations resulted in the deaths of four alleged gang members, but failed to locate the group’s leader.In 2020, the group started to expand towards the coastal state of Sucre, where it displaced a local group and ally of the Tren de Aragua, known as Los Caraqueños. Nevertheless, at the end of 2021, the group was targeted by a security force operation, that ended with the death of Gilberto Malony Hernández, alias “Malony,” its leader. A few months later, members of the Tren del Llano published a video in which they could be seen extorting local agricultural producers. Then in April 2022, the group was attacked by security forces in its stronghold of Guárico, as part of Operation Thunder.","At its inception, Tren del Llano was headed by Tovar, who recruited the ten-man nucleus of the group from former prisoners at the General Penitentiary of Venezuela (PGV). Throughout his time as the leader of Tren del Llano, he is understood to have maintained contacts with pranes in the PGV, according to a profile of Tovar published by RunRun.Following Tovar’s death on May 3, 2016, the group underwent a period of uncertainty with regards to its future and leadership. However, Venezuelan police considered Gilberto Malony Hernández, known as “Malony,” to be Tovar’s primary heir. Malony was in charge of one of the regional branches of Tren del Llano in Altagracia de Orituco when Tovar was alive. According to media reports, he was wanted for more than 10 different offenses, among them homicide and robbery.According to some reports, a parallel faction of Tren del Llano is led by another of Tovar’s lieutenants, Manuel Alejandro Moyetones Castillo, alias “El Mandarria.” In August 2019, Peruvian media reported him to be hiding out in Lima.In November 2021, Malony was neutralized by security forces in Sucre state. In May 2022, one of his possible successors, Carlos José Pirela Armas, alias “Carlos Pirela,” was found dead in Tucupido, Guárico. His own men are believed to have killed him. It is currently unclear who inherited leadership of the group in Guárico or Sucre, although Pirela's murder exposed the group's internal divisions.","The Tren de Llano was based in the state of Guarico and also had considerable control in Aragua. By 2014, it established an operational base in the neighborhood of El Sombrero in the state of Guarico, which also happened to be the hometown of leader ""El Picure."" By the end of 2015, there were major concerns raised that Tren de Llano was making gains in the state of Miranda and territories surrounding Caracas.After Tovar’s death, the group seems to have centered its operations in Malony’s stronghold of Altagracia de Orituco, Guarico. InSight Crime’s sources in the region state that the group continues to play a role in moving drug shipments from the neighboring state of Apure towards the Caribbean coast.In 2020, the group expanded to the coastal state of Sucre, where they settled in San Juan de Unare and San Juan de las Galdonas. However, an operation against the group in November 2021 appears to have forced them to retreat from the area.","Over the course of his criminal history, Tovar developed relationships with both international and local criminal gangs. In its early years, Tren del Llano was alleged to have connections to Colombian armed groups, specifically paramilitaries, through which his group sourced both drugs and weapons. Tren de Llano also reportedly maintained ties with another neighboring megabanda called ""Tren de Aragua,"" but his death appears to have curtailed this possibility. Indeed, Tren de Aragua’s leaders celebrated Tovar’s killing, claiming that it removed their principal competitor. Additionally, in the midst of its expansion into Sucre state, the Tren del Llano went head-to-head with Los Caraqueños, a cell affiliated with the Tren de Aragua in the area.Since Tovar’s death, it is uncertain exactly how the current factions of Tren del Llano relate to one another. There was little evidence of open hostility between the groups led by Malony and Mandarria, but there also is no evidence that they cooperate. In 2019, both were heavily targeted by the Venezuelan police's special action forces (Fuerzas de Acciones Especiales – FAES).Since November 2021, the group has been the target of two special operations by Venezuelan security forces in Sucre and Guarico. There are several theories as to why the Tren del Llano has been targeted by the regime, among them, that the group participated in the theft of a drug shipment belonging to the Cartel of the Suns. Other sources claim they stole money destined for political campaigns in the state.","The Tren del Llano has maintained a much lower profile since the operations launched against them in November 2021 and April 2022. The group has published videos stating their goal of maintaining a presence in Sucre and Guárico, but for the moment, they seem to have retreated. Additionally, the lack of clear leadership within the group, exposes it to internal divisions that can lead to several individual groups fighting for power.",
FARC 57th Front in Panama,https://insightcrime.org/panama-organized-crime-news/farc-57th-front-in-panama/,FARC 57th Front in Panama,,./images/organizations/farc-57th-front-in-panama.jpg,2016-11-04,"['panama', 'panama groups']",panama,"The FARC's 57th Front is active along the Colombia-Panama border, where it has long used the dense strip of jungle known as the Darién Gap to traffic drugs into Central America and weapons into Colombia. It also uses Panama as a refuge from Colombian security forces.The front is known to collaborate with transnational drug trafficking organizations, notably those from Mexico and Colombia. The guerrilla unit has also been implicated in the discovery of coca plantations and cocaine processing laboratories in the Darién area.Panamanian and Colombian authorities often collaborate in operations against this faction, which have reportedly weakened the group over the past few years.","The Marxist rebel group Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) was formed in Colombia in the 1960s. The 57th Front was established in the 1990s as part of the FARC's Northwestern Bloc, or Iván Ríos Bloc. The earliest records of illegal activity by guerrillas in Panamanian territory date back to 1993 with the kidnapping of US citizens Ricardo Tenenoff, David Mankins and Marcos Rich.Although the FARC has claimed that it only imposes taxes on cocaine traffickers, the 57th Front is known to be involved in cocaine trafficking to Central America, North America and Europe, in collaboration with transnational criminal organizations. The front handles the majority of the Iván Ríos Bloc's drug trafficking movements into Panama, while moving arms into Colombia. The unit has also been implicated in coca cultivation and cocaine processing in the Darién region.In order to move drugs through the barely penetrable 60-mile stretch of jungle separating Colombia and Panama, the 57th Front uses the Darien Gap's indigenous inhabitants of the Emberá and Wounaan tribes as drugs mules and guides. The illegal goods are transported by foot as well as by small boat. There are reports of indigenous locals being threatened and forced to collaborate with the guerrilla, while others are offered payments of up to $300 per drug load. Children are especially exploited for this use.The front also reportedly raids villages, steals supplies, assaults local women and sets up landmines. The guerrillas' violence and clashes with authorities have prompted the displacement of many locals. The front is known to practice extortion and has retaliated violently against those who fail to pay.Following a 2013 ambush that led to the death of a commander of the 57th Front, Virgilio Antonio Vidal Mora, alias ""Silver,"" authorities discovered the group's financial records from January to August 2013. In these eight months, the front made a net income of approximately $900,000 (2.7 billion Colombian pesos). Its revenue streams included ""taxing"" drug traffickers and seizing drugs from those who refused to pay the fee. The front also spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on weaponry such as grenades, rifles, shotguns, M79 grenade launchers and ammunition. Other expenses included legal costs for arrested members, payments for hit men, and the purchase of real estate to launder drug money.The front is politically active to an extent; the seized records showed that it spent hundreds of thousands of dollars financing the Marcha Patriótica, a left-wing political movement associated with the FARC.This faction's numbers have been dropping over the past few years due to Panama's continued security efforts and peace negotiations between the FARC organization and the Colombian government. In 2009, during its peak period, it was reported that the front was over a thousand strong. By 2015, the group's membership had reportedly declined to 220 members.The 57th Front has been heavily targeted by authorities on both sides of the border. Panama's border police and the Colombian Army announced in 2013 that they would build a joint base on the border to fight the FARC's illicit activities in the region.Tactics used by Panamanian security officials have included attempting to squeeze the guerrillas out of the Darién region by blocking supplies and restricting transport in the area. However, this form of police enforcement also inhibits the movement of indigenous communities.Authorities have seized hundreds of kilograms of cocaine, firearms and explosives in raids on the 57th Front.","José David Suárez, alias ""El Becerro,"" was the head of the 57th Front until his death in March 2015 after allegedly being betrayed by people within his security detail. A member of the FARC's Central General Staff, El Becerro oversaw the finances and weapon purchases for the Iván Ríos Bloc. He was believed to spend the majority of his time on the Panamanian side of the border and negotiated illicit business deals in Panama City. El Becerro allegedly worked with Panamanian traffickers to move drugs north using go-fast boats, and he reportedly maintained links to Honduran, Guatemalan, and Nicaraguan criminal groups.The guerrilla commander appears to have been highly influential in the FARC's move into transnational drug trafficking. In the 1990s, El Becerro reportedly decided that the FARC should expand their activities from taxing coca farmers to controlling other stages of the drug trade.Virgilio Antonio Vidal Mora, alias ""Silver,"" one of the front's commanders, played a key role in the group's finances. According to some reports, he provided the main source of financial support for the entire FARC organization, and was an extravagant spender of the unit's drug-based earnings. Vidal Mora was known to carry out drug trafficking and kidnapping activities in the region, and was believed to be responsible for 70 percent of disappearances in the Antioquia and Chocó departments of Colombia. After nearly 30 years with the 57th Front, Vidal Mora was killed in a bomb attack by Colombian air forces on August 25, 2013.Another of the front's commanders is reportedly the Panamanian national José Luis Valencia Mosquera Asprilla, alias ""El Pana,"" who served as a police officer in Panama for two years before joining the Colombian rebels in 2001.","The front is mainly based along the Colombia-Panama border, where the dense jungle of the Darién Gap is located. In Colombia, it is present in the Chocó department's Urabá region.","The 57th Front has a long-standing agreement with Colombia's most powerful drug trafficking organization, the Urabeños, which specifies territorial boundaries, drug movements and possibly the pooling of drug shipments. The Urabeños have reportedly helped defend the 57th Front from Colombian security forces.The front also supplies drugs directly to Mexican cartels. Emissaries of Mexico's Sinaloa and Zetas cartels have been detected in the border region, obtaining coca base for trafficking to North America and Europe.","In recent years, Panamanian security efforts and peace negotiations between the Colombian government and the FARC organization have reduced the threat posed by the 57th Front in Panama. Nevertheless, the strong criminal finances offered by the border region and the unit's ties to international organized crime increase the likelihood of its members choosing to remain in the field should the FARC demobilize.",
Atlantic Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/honduras-organized-crime-news/atlantic-cartel-profile/,Atlantic Cartel,,./images/organizations/atlantic-cartel.jpg,2017-08-28,"['honduras', 'honduras groups']",honduras,"The Atlantic Cartel is a Honduran drug trafficking organization reportedly led by Wilter Neptalí Blanco Ruíz. The group's alleged connections with high-ranking military officials, police and politicians, along with the decline of the country's powerful narco-clans, have made it one of the largest and best-organized criminal operations in Honduras. The cartel operates in the departments of Gracias a Dios, Colón, Islas de la Bahía and Atlántida, where it manages drug-smuggling routes. ","The origins of the Atlantic Cartel are murky, but a 2016 US indictment alleges that Wilter Blanco has been involved in drug trafficking since at least 1999. A longtime resident of the eastern La Mosquitia region of Honduras, Blanco was the owner of various seafood export businesses as well as several luxury estates, where he reportedly hosted parties. It is likely that the transportation infrastructure of his export businesses, combined with the personal connections he made at parties he hosted, provided Blanco with the resources necessary to thrive in the drug trade. In fact, a 2010 police intelligence document reportedly stated that Blanco paid for parties attended by high-ranking police officials, prosecutors and judges.According to local press reports, Honduran anti-drug officials first began investigating Wilter Blanco in 2006, one year after Julián Arístides González Irías had assumed the top position in the country's national anti-narcotics agency. Little appears to have come from these investigations until June 2009, when González launched an operation that quashed Blanco's plan to use corrupt police officers to steal 143 kilograms of cocaine belonging to Emilio Fernández Rosa, alias ""Don H,"" a rival drug trafficker in La Mosquitia.González was assassinated by corrupt police officers just five months later, in December 2009. Honduran investigators later accused Blanco of ordering the murder as payback for disrupting the drug theft. Two years later, in December 2011, Blanco also allegedly ordered some of the same officers to assassinate González's chief advisor, Gustavo Alfredo Landaverde Hernández, who had publicly denounced criminal activity within the police force. Neither case has gone to court.The investigations of the murders of González and Landaverde languished for years, and the cases came to exemplify the extent of criminality and impunity within the Honduran police force. In 2014, recordings surfaced from a police station known as the Casamata, or ""Slaughter House,"" which showed officers discussing plans to execute González. Shortly thereafter, a police officer who had retrieved the recordings, apparently planning to turn them over to investigators, was found dead.Efforts to crack down on the Atlantic Cartel's operations seem to have been revived in April 2015, when Honduran authorities began to seize property belonging to Blanco, including businesses, luxury villas, cars, boats and bank accounts. To date, authorities have seized more than 140 of Blanco's properties in the departments of Atlántida, Yoro and Colón.In May 2016, Honduran authorities quietly issued an arrest warrant for Blanco, who has been charged with money laundering in Honduras. Several months later, on September 14, Honduran police reportedly arrested the suspected drug trafficker together with three of his associates, but they were inexplicably released shortly thereafter.Less than a month later, on October 7, the US Embassy in Honduras announced that Blanco was under investigation for drug trafficking and corruption along with seven other suspects, including members of the Honduran military and police. Local press reports indicated that some 35 individuals, including businessmen, mayors, congressmen and judges, were also under investigation. On October 17, InSight Crime reported that a US embassy source said that Juan Antonio ""Tony"" Hernández, the brother of Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández, was considered a ""person of interest"" in the investigation.Also on October 17, a US federal court unsealed an August 5 indictment charging Blanco with involvement in a cocaine trafficking conspiracy stretching back to at least 1999. Several local media outlets reported that Blanco was preparing to turn himself in to authorities, but he was instead captured in November 2016 in Costa Rica. Aside from Blanco, though, none of the others named on the list have been indicted in the US.Blanco pleaded guilty to drug trafficking charges on July 2 and agreed to provide information on other criminal organizations to US authorities.","The Atlantic Cartel is reportedly led by accused drug trafficker Wilter Blanco. Blanco's alleged deputy is Óscar Aragón Everest, a member of the cartel who operates in the Palacios region of the Gracias a Dios department. Other suspected top members of the group include Fredy Donaldo Mármol Vallejo, a convicted drug trafficker and money launderer, and Johana Martínez, about whom little is publicly known.","The Atlantic Cartel is largely based in the La Mosquitia region on the northeastern Atlantic coast of Honduras. However, the group also reportedly maintains a presence in the nearby departments of Gracias a Dios, Colón, Islas de la Bahía and Atlántida. The Atlantic Cartel appears to also operate in the western departments of Copán and Ocotepeque, the former stronghold of the Valle-Valle drug clan, where the group has established important alliances with the AA Brothers Cartel, allegedly headed by a former local mayor named Alexander Ardón and his brother, Hugo Ardón, a former top government operative.","The success of the Atlantic Cartel depends largely on the protection the group reportedly receives fromhigh-ranking military, police and judicial authorities in Honduras. Despite increasing pressure in recent years, the Atlantic Cartel reportedly continues operate in La Mosquitia, aided by local police and military officials who allegedly allow a ""happy hour"" during which traffickers can load and unload drug shipments without repercussions from the authorities.Aside from members of law enforcement, the military and key public figures, the Atlantic Cartel has managed to establish alliances with other drug trafficking groups based inside and outside Honduras. Chief among these is the relationship the group maintains with the AA Brothers Cartel. The territories controlled by the two groups border one another, and the Atlantic Cartel allegedly maintains the relationship in order to access airplane runways in the Gracias a Dios department and riverine routes in Copán.Additionally, the Atlantic Cartel has been linked to Víctor Manuel Villela, alias ""El Rojo,"" a suspected drug trafficker also operating on the Atlantic coast. According to police reports reviewed by El Heraldo, the Atlantic Cartel, El Rojo's organization and the AA Brothers Cartel comprise a ""megastructure"" that plays a prominent role in drug trafficking and money laundering in Honduras. The Atlantic Cartel has also been linked to Roberto de Jesús Soto García, a prominent member of the Cartel of the Suns, a drug trafficking organization composed of members of the Venezuelan military. Soto has been accused of helping facilitate a drug deal involving nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, who allegedly planned to ship drugs from Venezuela to Honduras and on to the United States. Soto García was arrested in Honduras in October 2016 and is expected to be extradited to the United States on drug charges.","Following an attack on a group of US anti-drug agents by suspected Atlantic Cartel operatives, and reported threats against US Ambassador to Honduras James Nealon in October 2016, the United States appears to be more determined than ever to dismantle the group. The successes of previous US-backed operations against Honduran criminal organizations like the Valle Valle family suggest that the Atlantic Cartel may not be able to withstand the increasing pressure that is being brought against it. Indeed, an operation involving US, Honduran and Costa Rican authorities led to the capture of cartel leader Wilter Blanco in November 2016 in Costa Rica. After pleading guilty to drug trafficking charges July 2, 2017, Blanco agreed to cooperate with US authorities. On August 17, 2017, Blanco was sentenced by a US federal court in Miami to 20 years imprisonment. It is possible that Blanco may reveal information to authorities that will help them dismantle what remains of the Atlantic Cartel.",
Calor Calor,https://insightcrime.org/panama-organized-crime-news/calor-calor-profile/,Calor Calor,,./images/organizations/calor-calor.jpg,2021-11-03,"['panama', 'panama groups']",panama,"Calor Calor is one of Panama’s two most powerful gangs along with Bagdad, and the two battle fiercely for territorial control.“Bagdad” along with its rival Calor Calor is one of Panama’s two main gang federations, consisting of 30-40 smaller gangs that work together to fulfill drug transportation for transnational organized crime groups, but who have no internal loyalty and often feud on the street level over microtrafficking.While Panamanian gangs once mostly engaged in petty crime, today, Calor Calor focuses on providing drug transport and other services to transnational trafficking organizations. Members of Calor Calor also engage in microtrafficking.The gang has participated in a rapid rise in homicides in the country since 2019 as more and more cocaine has flowed through the country, leading to greater violence between gangs for control of these shipments.","Calor Calor’s current structure was formed when the powerful “tumbadores” (drug theft) gang Unión Soviética — where Bagdad has its origins — began decimating other youth gangs. These joined ranks in Calor Calor, which offered youths the protection of a larger, more structured organization.Its main activity is transporting drugs for sophisticated Colombian and Mexican organized criminal groups, and Calor Calor manages drug trafficking routes and logistics. Gang members are also subcontracted to carry out contract killings and drug robberies and to provide security for drug shipments.Calor Calor is now one of two main agglomerations of gangs in Panama, along with rival organization Bagdad. Turf battles between the two groups have expanded from the capital, Panama City, into the Panama Oeste province, across the canal.In 2016, the group’s leader was allegedly Dangelo Ramírez Ramea, although he has denied being the head of the group.In 2005, Ramírez Ramea allegedly participated in the robbery of $2.5 million from the International Commercial Bank of China in the Colón Free Trade Zone. He was captured in 2009 during an operation in which $1 million in cash was seized, and was reportedly recaptured in 2011 and accused of committing crimes abroad as part of an international organized crime network linked to drug trafficking. Ramírez Ramea has also been investigated for money laundering, extortion and other crimes.Ramírez Ramea was described as one of the country’s most dangerous criminals by President Juan Carlos Varela in 2015 and was briefly one of the only six inmates in the maximum-security prison of Punta Coco. However, in June 2016, he was absolved of money laundering charges and freed from custody.José Cossio has also been described as the head of Calor Calor. He has been in prison in Panama since 2015.Cossio allegedly participated in the 2005 Bank of China robbery, and in 2010 he was arrested in the United States for possession and intent to distribute cocaine. He was again arrested in Panama in 2011 for homicide. Three years later he was linked to the seizure of 191 kilograms of cocaine in Panama’s metropolitan region. Cossio is also suspected of murdering a Panamanian beauty contestant in 2014.Two months after entering La Joya prison in 2014, he escaped to Costa Rica with Costa Rican associate alias “Kike El Tico.” El Siglo reported that large bribes were apparently paid to to facilitate the escape.Cossio was captured in Costa Rica and extradited to Panama in 2015. He was briefly held in Punta Coco prison, before being transferred to another facility due to human rights concerns.Since 2019, Calor Calor appears to have slipped a bit in comparison to Bagdad as far as its criminal reach and control of shipments. However, Bagdad has been weakened by internal rifts, violence between its members and due to being targeted by a sweeping operation between Panamanian security forces and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).In October 2021, a leading member of the gang, Jean Carlos Navarro Cunningham, alias “Chombolín,” was shot along with his wife and 3-year-old daughter while driving in Panama City. This was seen as one of the more brazen attempts against the life of a Calor Calor member and symbolic of a worrying pattern of increasing violence in the country.","The current leader of Calor Calor is Eduardo Macea, alias Marshall. Marshall is currently in the high-security Punta Coca prison on drug trafficking, homicide and arms trafficking charges. His defense team denies all charges against him, though he is considered highly dangerous by authorities and allegedly has a reputation for violence.In 2022, local media reported that Macea continued to run the gang's drug-running business from prison.","The stronghold of Calor Calor is the Panama City district of San Miguelito. The gang is also present in the El Chorrillo, Santa Ana, Calidonia, Río Abajo neighborhoods of the capital, and is strong in Colón, the world’s second biggest free trade zone located on the Caribbean end of the Panama Canal. Bagdad and Calor Calor members often are found in close proximity to each other.Calor Calor has made a push into Bagdad’s turf in Panama Oeste, causing intense violence between the two groups. The rival blocs allegedly reached a shaky pact in which it was decided that Bagdad would maintain control of La Chorrera district, and Calor Calor of Arraiján district.Drugs transit along Panama Oeste’s coastline, where the two gangs provide services to trafficking organizations and steal drug shipments.Calor Calor also sends gang members to the jungle border regions to manage drug trafficking routes.","Calor Calor originated from and remains an agglomeration of numerous youth gangs. Its main rival is Bagdad, another criminal bloc.Together, they are the two biggest local gangs in Panama and their rivalry centers around control of strategically located ports, shares of the international drug trade, especially the European market and over the personal rivalry between Marshall and the leader of Bagdad, Jaime Powell, alias “Yunya.”Yunya and Marshall started out working together under Juan Vicente Blandford, alias ""El Pátron Juancito, but began fighting in 2014, when members of Calor Calor’s structure moved to Bagdad. Yunya has the reputation of being the less violent of the two criminals, while Marshall has a reputation for ruthlessness. El Pátron Juancito was captured in 2019, but is, reportedly, still trying to unite the two from within prison.","Calor Calor’s operations in transnational drug trafficking have become more sophisticated and its role has changed from a subordinate to a subcontractor that brokers shipment of drugs for Colombian and Mexican groups through Panama and beyond, according to InSight Crime field research. Though Calor Calor is likely to remain a middle man in the transnational drug trade, the business is lucrative and the stakes are getting higher.Because there is more money to be made than when they were first formed, Calor Calor, as well as its rival Bagdad, has responded by consolidating power and upping the violence. Whether they continue to grow in power depends on the effectiveness of Panama’s government policies, which have recently started to change. After coming to power at the end of 2019, the Cortizo Administration has discontinued social and rehabilitation programs, while investing heavily in mano dura security policies and forces.In 2021, despite Bagdad growing more prominent as Panama's leading gang, the Calor Calor federation of gangs remains a crucial part of Panama's drug trafficking landscape, moving numerous shipments of drugs through the country and running microtrafficking in numerous neighborhoods of Panama City.",
Guerreros Unidos,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/guerreros-unidos-mexico/,Guerreros Unidos,,./images/organizations/guerreros-unidos.jpg,2021-08-13,"['guerreros unidos', 'mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"The Guerreros Unidos are a splinter group of the Beltran Leyva Organization (BLO) based in central Mexico. The group is dedicated mainly to extortion and kidnapping, but also sends drugs to the United States. The Guerreros Unidos are characterized by their aggressive tactics and use of extreme violence, which have attracted the attention of security forces and threatened the group's long-term survival.","The Guerreros Unidos are one of at least seven BLO splinter groups that formed following the death of BLO leader Arturo Beltran Leyva in 2009. The group was founded by Mario Casarrubias Salgado, alias “El Sapo Guapo,” who served as part of the BLO security team, and Cleotilde Toribio Renteria alias “El Tilde,” who was a member of the hit squad of BLO operative Edgar Valdez Villarreal, alias “La Barbie,” along with several former BLO bodyguards.The Guerreros Unidos made their first public appearance in December 2011, when the group claimed responsibility for a triple homicide in the state of Morelos. Over the following year, the Guerreros Unidos carried out several high-profile attacks, including a string of attacks on bars in Morelos that left five dead and 15 wounded. In December 2012, the group also sent hitmen disguised as doctors to kill the leader of rival BLO splinter group Los Rojos while he was recovering from another assassination attempt in a hospital in Mexico City.As fighting between the Guerreros Unidos and rival groups including Los Rojos led to spikes in violence in the states of Morelos and Guerrero, however, security forces began to target the criminal organization. Founder El Tilde was arrested in Mexico City in July 2012, and El Sapo Guapo was captured in April 2014 in the state of Mexico (Edomex), later dying after contracting COVID-19 in the Altiplano prison in July 2021.Twenty-two alleged Guerreros Unidos members were killed in a battle with the Mexican army in June 2014, in an incident in which the military has been accused of human rights abuses.A September 2014 attack on student protesters in Iguala, Guerrero, which has been attributed to the Guerreros Unidos, intensified security operations against the group. According to Mexican authorities, local police detained 43 students and handed them over to the Guerreros Unidos, who—according to the official narrative—proceeded to murder the students and burn their bodies in what would eventually become known as the Ayotzinapa Massacre. The disappearance of the students prompted the federal government to launch additional operations against the group, which led to the capture of El Sapo Guapo's brother Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado, alias “El Chino,” along with other high-level operatives. One alleged leader, Benjamin Mondragon Pereda, alias “El Benjamon,” shot himself in October 2014 after he was surrounded by the police.In October 2014, Jonathan Osorio and Patricio Reyes Landa, presumed members of Guerreros Unidos, admitted their involvement in the Ayotzinapa Massacre to federal law enforcement. According to statements made by both men, they received the students from the Iguala and Cocula police forces and then executed and burned all the bodies. In a text message received by then leader Sidronio Casarrubias Salgado from someone known only by the alias “El Gil,” it’s confirmed that the students’ bodies were burned and dumped in a river.While the admission and the text seemed enough to connect the event to the Guerreros Unidos and made Osorio and Reyes Landa the guilty party, the federal government claimed that further investigations failed to corroborate the story and forced law enforcement to release Osorio and Reyes Landa.In 2018, newly inaugurated President Andrés Manuel López Obrador used his first decree to establish a truth commission to uncover the events that led to the Ayotzinapa Massacre. Since the establishment of the truth commission, dozens of arrest warrants have been issued for government officials and law enforcement authorities who were found to be involved in the massacre. However, only a few members of Guerreros Unidos have so far been prosecuted in relation to the massacre.","Mexico's Attorney General's Office stated in 2015 that Guerreros Unidos had a hierarchical leadership structure, with members receiving orders directly from their superiors. However, the group has gone through a series of leaders since mid-2012, and it remains unclear if a single person has taken control after El Sapo Guapo’s arrest and death. Nowadays, it appears that the group may have a decentralized structure with several leaders.For example, Mexican officials have identified “El Chino” as one of the group’s leaders, as well as Salomón Pineda Villa, alias “El Molón”, the former brother-in-law of the former mayor of Iguala. An alleged Guerreros Unidos operative referred to only as “El Chucky” o “El Choky” has also been identified as a potential leader. In early July 2021, Moisés Brito, alias “El Bandam”, was killed in a shootout in Morelos. Press reports also identified him as one of the leaders of the organization.","According to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Guerreros Unidos is currently an important player in the production and trafficking of heroin in the state of Guerrero. Additionally, the group also operates in the states of Morelos and Estado de México, where it is mainly involved in extortion and kidnapping.","The Guerreros Unidos' main enemy is Los Rojos, who the organization has been fighting for control of drug trafficking routes (a rivalry that may have motivated the Iguala student massacre). The Guerreros Unidos have also fought against the Familia Michoacana and the Knights Templar cartels. The Mexican guerrilla group the Insurgent People's Revolutionary Army (ERPI) also declared themselves enemies of the Guerreros Unidos following the disappearance of the 43 students.According to the DEA, Guerreros Unidos is currently working with the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (CJNG), with whom they have partnered with to control drug routes and have access to distribution networks in the United States.","The Guerreros Unidos' violent tactics and use of kidnapping as a source of revenue have made them a target of both national and state security forces. The group has lost several leaders and dozens of members as a result of security operations.On the other hand, the attacks against the student protesters in Iguala have revealed the group's extensive ties to local officials. The capture of an alleged Guerreros Unidos financial chief in October 2014, for example, revealed that the group allegedly spent close to $45,000 a month to pay off local police in the municipality of Iguala alone. These local ties could make it more difficult for Mexican authorities to target the group.   ",
Pure Third Command,https://insightcrime.org/brazil-organized-crime-news/pure-third-command/,Pure Third Command,,./images/organizations/pure-third-command.jpg,2018-04-26,"['brazil', 'brazil groups', 'pure third command']",brazil,"The Pure Third Command (Terceiro Comando Puro) is one of the most powerful criminal groups in Brazil’s second-largest city, Rio de Janeiro. Its origins can be traced back to a split within the Rio-based Red Command prison gang in the mid-1980s. While the Pure Third Command is not as dominant as its rivals like the Red Command or the Rio-based Amigos dos Amigos, the group has maintained strongholds in north and west Rio and may be forging new alliances to expand their territorial control.","The Pure Third Command, founded in 2002, has its roots in the now-defunct Third Command (Terceiro Comando). In the mid-1980s, enterprising members of the Red Command (Comando Vermelho) split off to form the breakaway group to take advantage of Brazil’s rapidly expanding drug market.Some analysts have suggested the impetus for the split was a leadership vacuum in the Red Command, which at the time was headed by a younger generation of less-stable gangsters. The dissident Red Command members who formed the Third Command were seeking to establish a more efficient, business-like approach to the drug trade.Throughout most of the 1990s, the Red Command and its offshoot, the Third Command, were the dominant criminal actors in Rio de Janeiro, with their affiliates battling over control of drug trafficking and extortion rackets across the city.The Third Command formed a loose alliance in the late 1990s with another newly emerging breakaway group formed by ex-Red Command members known as Amigos dos Amigos. Both gangs concentrated their efforts on territory held by the Red Command.The Third Command-Amigos dos Amigos pact sparked tensions that eventually led to the collapse of the Third Command in the early 2000s. Third Command kingpin Nei da Conceição Cruz, alias “Facão,” who oversaw the group’s drug trafficking activities in the northern area of Rio known as Complexo da Mare, became frustrated over a perceived encroachment on his territory by Amigos dos Amigos boss Paulo Cesar Silva dos Santos, alias “Linho.” As a result, Facão split from the Third Command in 2002, creating his own organization and declaring war on both former allies.Facão’s group remained a relatively minor player until September 2002, when the Third Command’s imprisoned leadership was wiped out in a series of hits orchestrated by the Red Command with the help of Amigos dos Amigos co-founder Celso Luis Rodrigues, alias “Celsinho da Vila Vintem.”The Third Command’s remaining members defected to more powerful organizations. Most local drug bosses swore their allegiance to either the Amigos dos Amigos or Facão, who took advantage of the incident to name his gang the “Pure” Third Command.The Pure Third Command has since dominated control over drug sales in northern and western Rio, with a particularly strong presence in the Senador Camará neighborhood in the city's West Zone and Ilha do Governador, the largest island in Rio’s Guanabara Bay. In recent years, the criminal group has expanded its activities from drug trafficking to extortion of basic services in the neighborhoods under its control.In 2018, authorities in Rio de Janeiro began investigating rumors that the Pure Third Command had formed an alliance with the Amigos dos Amigos, creating a new faction called the Amigos’ Third Command (Terceiro Comando dos Amigos). According to Rio de Janeiro police intelligence, imprisoned Amigos dos Amigos drug boss Antônio Bonfim Lopes, alias “Nem,” has supplied the new group with weapons. This offshoot of the Pure Third Command is also thought to have formed an alliance with Brazil’s largest and best-organized criminal organization, the First Capital Command (Primeiro Comando da Capital – PCC), following the 2016 dissolution of the group’s long-standing truce with the Red Command.","The Pure Third Command, like Rio’s other top criminal groups, lacks a strong hierarchy. Rather than a vertical, mafia-type organization, the group functions as a loose horizontal coalition of local crime bosses who forge alliances based on mutually beneficial interests. Many of the Pure Third Command’s top leaders have avoided arrest by employing an effective system of lookouts and paying bribes to both civil and military police officers.The group’s founding leader Facão was arrested and imprisoned in 2009, and was succeeded by Marcio José Sabino Pereira, alias “Matemático,” until his death during a 2012 gunfight with police.Fernando Gomes de Freitas, alias “Fernandinho Guarabu,” remains the Pure Third Command’s oldest leader still presiding over criminal activities. For more than a decade, Fernandinho Guarabu has overseen the group’s territorial hold over neighborhoods on Ilha do Governador. Despite repeated police operations in the area over the years, Fernandinho Guarabu has consistently evaded arrest.In 2017, Fernandinho Guarabu’s right-hand man Felipe Freire Melo was arrested on accusations he led a string of armed robberies of cargo trucks and was involved in drug trafficking activities.","While groups affiliated with the Pure Third Command operate across Rio de Janeiro, their territorial control is strongest in the North and West zones of the city. Their traditional strongholds include the neighborhoods of Ilha do Governador, Senador Camará and Complexo da Maré. The group may be attempting to expand its presence, having been accused in 2018 of attempting to invade the Red Command-controlled neighborhood of Morro da Babilônia in southern Rio de Janeiro.","The Pure Third Command has traditionally been pitted against Rio de Janeiro’s other two largest gangs, the Amigos dos Amigos and the Red Command. However, in recent years, the group may have forged an alliance with the Amigos dos Amigos, and may be partnering up with the São Paulo-based PCC to challenge the Red Command's dominance in Rio de Janeiro.The Pure Third Command’s main allies are corrupt security force officers, who largely turn a blind eye to their activities in exchange for kickbacks, and may occasionally supply the group with weapons.","The Pure Third Command has maintained control over key drug trafficking areas in north and west Rio de Janeiro despite temporary disruptions to their activities caused by police operations in the mid-2010s. Currently, the group may be attempting to monopolize on rising tensions following the 2016 breakdown of a truce between the Red Command and the PCC. Following the 2018 deployment of the national military to preside over Rio de Janeiro’s security operations, a Pure Third Command leader told an international news outlet that “nothing will change,” claiming the group will continue to sell drugs and retake control over important territory after the military presence is scaled back.",
Valles,https://insightcrime.org/honduras-organized-crime-news/honduras-los-valles/,Valles,,./images/organizations/valles.jpg,2020-03-09,"['honduras groups', 'valles']",honduras,"The US Treasury Department estimates the Valles moved ""tens of thousands of kilograms of cocaine"" into the United States each month, and the organization would make more than $800,000 on a single shipment, according to testimony from former associates. Though most of their trafficked cocaine ended up in the United States, they also provided it to the domestic market, establishing links with local distributors such as Los Pinto, which operates in the south of Honduras.In addition to drug transport, the Valle family is heavily involved in real estate, with hotels and other property in the capital of Copán department and smaller municipalities. Like many other groups, they seem to have a diverse criminal repertoire beyond cocaine transportation, including links to arms smuggling and money laundering.In addition to coffee farms and cattle ranches, the family’s business interests have included fitness centers, commercial centers, hardware stores, and even a cable television company.Nearly the entire leadership structure of the group has been dismantled, with top leaders extradited to stand trial in the United States, leaving the future of the organization in question.","The Valles’ origins as drug traffickers are unclear, but Miguel Arnulfo Valle Valle, alias “Colocho,” and his younger brother Luis Alfonso created one of the region’s most influential and best-organized trafficking groups controlling Honduras’ borders. Compared to other groups like the Cachiros, they employed a relatively small number of people, most of whom have maintained a very low profile.","The Valles were led by Miguel Arnulfo Valle Valle and his two brothers Luis Alfonso and Jose Reynerio. Their sister, Digna Valle Valle, was the first of the siblings to fall. She was arrested in an airport in the US state of Florida on July 20, 2014.",,,"In July 2014, Digna Valle Valle was arrested in the US state of Florida. Shortly afterward, in August, Honduran authorities moved against the Valles’ properties, seizing more than 50 in one operation. Days later, the US Treasury added the three brothers -- Miguel Arnulfo, Luis Alfonso and Jose Reynerio -- to its “kingpin list,” drawing the future of the group into question.Just three months after being added to the kingpin list, Honduran security forces arrested two of the brothers -- who were then extradited to the United States -- and subsequently dismantled virtually all of the Valles’ leadership structure.The arrests allegedly went forward because the group attempted to assassinate President Juan Orlando Hernández shortly after he took office in 2014, according to testimony given by Ardón at the trial of the President's brother, Tony Hernández.Now that so many of the Valle Valle siblings have been arrested and extradited, it is possible that the clan’s weakened operations are being led by their children, several of whom have themselves been arrested in recent years.",
Beltrán Leyva Organization,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/beltran-leyva-organization-profile/,Beltrán Leyva Organization,,./images/organizations/beltrán-leyva-organization.jpg,2021-10-06,"['beltran leyva org', 'mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"Led by the Beltrán Leyva brothers, this Mexican drug trafficking organization worked with the Sinaloa Cartel before the two split and began a bloody war in 2008. Once one of Mexico's most powerful groups, the BLO is now defunct after numerous arrests and murders.The Beltrán Leyva Organization (BLO) experienced a void in leadership, due to the death of Juan Francisco Patrón Sánchez, alias ""H2,"" in 2017 during a shootout with Marines, and the 2014 arrest of Hector Beltrán Leyva, alias ""El H."" During his time as leader, El H strengthened an alliance with the Zetas in an effort to stave off elimination following a bloody battle with the Sinaloa Cartel. But by 2021, it is no longer a relevant player, although some splinter groups still lay claim to the name.","By most accounts, the Beltrán Leyva brothers began their criminal career working in their home state of Sinaloa with small-time opium poppy growers. The Sinaloa region was, and remains, the heart of poppy cultivation in Mexico. The brothers went on to work for Amado Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""Señor de los Cielos,""who employed them as hitmen and transporters. Carrillo Fuentes ran the powerful Juarez Cartel, which had established drug trafficking routes stretching south to Colombia and north into the United States.Like their boss, the Beltrán Leyvas were ruthless and ambitious. Their home municipality, Badiraguato, is the same as that of Joaquin Guzman Loera, alias ""El Chapo,"" and there is some evidence the men worked together as hitmen for the infamous Guadalajara Cartel. Through marriage, the Guzman Loera and Beltrán Leyva families became closer and more tightly aligned. This connection proved critical when Guzman was jailed in 1993 -- the Beltrán Leyva brothers helped Guzman's brother, Arturo, maintain the business and shuttled cash to their imprisoned Sinaloan ""cousin,"" helping him escape in 2001.Guzman's escape, the capture of his brother Arturo several months later, and the death of Carrillo Fuentes opened the door for the Beltrán Leyva brothers. After several meetings in 2002 with Guzman and his partners, Juan Jose Esparragoza Moreno, alias ""El Azul,"" and Ismael Zambada Garcia, alias ""El Mayo,"" the group formed what became known as the Federation, or the ""Alianza de Sangre"" (Blood Alliance). Alfredo Beltrán Leyva, alias ""El Mochomo,"" married Guzman's cousin. Esparragoza married Guzman's sister-in-law. Guzman later married the niece of another partner, Ignacio Coronel.As godfather to Amado Carrillo Fuentes' son, Esparragoza was also closely tied to the Carrillo Fuentes clan. The Juarez-based family was brought into the pact in 2002, but the relationship did not last. In 2004, Amado Carrillo Fuentes' brother, Rodolfo Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""El Niño de Oro,"" killed two of Guzman's operatives in Ciudad Juárez. Guzman had him assassinated. Faced with a choice, Zambada and Esparragoza picked Guzman's side, marking the beginning of a war between the Sinaloa and Juarez organizations that has raged ever since.In the meantime, the Beltrán Leyva Organization (BLO) began to make their mark. Guzman charged them with forming a security team for the cartel to combat the rising power of their other rivals, the Gulf Cartel. A few years earlier, the Gulf Cartel had lured 31 special forces officers from the Mexican military to create a powerful, sophisticated and brutal armed wing that called themselves the Zetas. The BLO recruited their own security team. One operative, Edgar Valdez Villareal, alias ""La Barbie,"" came from Laredo, across the river from the home base of the Zetas. Valdez's group, the Pelones, began to match the Zetas' brutality. Another group, the Negros, was led by a former police detective. At the top of the pyramid was Arturo Beltrán Leyva, alias ""El Jefe de Jefes."" Arturo created his own unit, which he called Arturo's Special Forces (Fuerzas Especiales de Arturo - FEDA). The war soon spread, as did the BLO's power and influence. By 2005, the BLO was reportedly operating in 10 states in addition to the Federal District (Mexico City).Guzman also tasked the Beltrán Leyva clan with penetrating the security and political forces, which they did with alarming efficiency. In 2005, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) recorded a conversation between Nahum Acosta, a close advisor to the Fox administration, and one of the Beltrán Leyvas, presumably Hector. Hector, alias ""El H,"" was responsible for the payroll, which also allegedly included top members of the government's National Investigative Agency (Agencia Federal de Investigacion - AFI) and the country's drug czar at the time, Noe Ramirez Mandujano. Ramirez was jailed for allegedly receiving $450,000 per month from the organization, but the charges were thrown out in April 2013. Acosta was arrested but later exonerated.The BLO clan was influential, but suffered from hubris. Their public profile steadily rose, as did their public appearances in extravagant parties in places like Cuernavaca, where their domain was undisputed. Their allies in the Sinaloa Cartel, meanwhile, appeared troubled. Added to this was a dispute over a distribution route in Chicago between the Sinaloa faction and the BLO. Tension boiled over when authorities arrested Alfredo Beltrán Leyva on January 21, 2008. After authorities released Guzman's son, Ivan Archivaldo, from jail on a technicality, Arturo Beltrán Leyva's fears were confirmed: Guzman had provided the information leading to the arrest of his younger brother, Alfredo.War was declared, and one of the first victims was Edgar Guzman, Joaquin Guzman's son, who was killed when he left a Sinaloa shopping center with his bodyguards. The levels of bloodshed in Sinaloa shot up. The BLO allied themselves with their former archrivals, the Zetas. The Sinaloa Cartel reached working agreements with the Gulf Cartel and the Familia Michoacana, a ruthless group that had burst onto the scene in 2006. Throughout, Guzman, Zambada and Esparragoza remained aligned against the BLO. Using their contacts in the federal government, the Sinaloa Cartel wore down the BLO. Dozens of operatives were arrested or killed in 2009. And in December 2009, Mexican Marines killed Arturo Beltrán Leyva after he'd barricaded himself in an apartment in an upscale neighborhood in Cuernavaca.The year 2010 was even worse for the BLO. Following the death of Arturo, Valdez Villareal split to form his own organization. Hector Beltrán Leyva regrouped what remained of the BLO and began calling his operation the South Pacific Cartel (Cartel del Pacifico Sur). However, the battles between the two factions left both vulnerable. Carlos Beltrán Leyva, a brother of Hector and Arturo, was arrested in January 2010. Valdez Villareal's top lieutenant was arrested in April, and Valdez Villareal himself was detained in August of that year. Hector's top security officer, Sergio Villareal, alias ""El Grande,"" was arrested in September 2010. The BLO's remnants have strengthened their alliance with the Zetas in order to stay afloat.But the group’s leadership has been further decimated in recent years. Mexican authorities arrested Hector Beltrán Leyva, alias “El H,” in October 2014 as well as Alfredo Beltrán Guzmán, alias “El Mochomito” -- another high-level BLO figure -- in December 2016. Juan Francisco Patrón Sánchez, alias ""H2,"" who succeeded “El H” at the head of the organization, was killed during a shootout with members of Mexico’s Marines in February 2017. El H died in custody in November 2018.The main BLO splinter groups are the Guerreros Unidos and Los Rojos. Both groups have been linked to the disappearances of 43 student students in Ayotzinapa, as well as high levels of violence in the states of Guerrero and Morelos.The Guerreros Unidos, which operate primarily in Morelos and Guerrero, primarily fight with Los Rojos over the heroin trade. They are also made up of several splinter groups including Los Tequileros, a cell in Tierra Caliente that specializes in extorting politicians.As for Los Rojos, they have become an important cell in the central and southeastern part of Mexico, especially the state of Guerrero. Accused of extortion, homicides, kidnappings, human trafficking and forced disappearances, they have been listed by DEA as an active heroin trafficking group with ties in the US and currently have an influence in the states of Morelos, Puebla, Mexico State and in the highlands of Guerrero.In 2020, the US accused former Mexican Defense Minister Salvador Cienfuegos Zepeda of working for the H-2 splinter of the BLO, before dropping all charges. The H-2 organization continues to operate as a drug trafficking group in Mexico.","The BLO was led by the Beltrán Leyva brothers, all of whom have been captured or killed.","The BLO formed in Mexico's Sinaloa state and operated in a number of different states, plus Mexico City, at the height of its power, including Guerrero, Morelos, Chiapas, Queretaro, Sinaloa, Jalisco, Quintana Roo, Tamaulipas, Nuevo León and the State of Mexico.","The BLO's alliance with the Zetas was particularly fruitful: together, they were able to deal significant blows to the Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico's Sierra Madre region. The group has additionally benefited from the assistance of long-time ally Fausto Isidro Meza Flores, alias ""Chapito Isidro,"" considered an important drug trafficker by the United States.In 2014, reports emerged that the BLO met with other major Mexican criminal groups -- including the Zetas, Juarez Cartel and Jalisco Cartel New Generation (CJNG) -- in order to mutually commit to battling the Sinaloa Cartel, the BLO's main rival.However, even their successors have been left behind by Sinaloa and CJNG and do not feature among Mexico’s foremost criminal threats.","With its leadership arrested or dead, the cartel is done as a functional criminal threat. However, some of its splinter groups, including the H-2, continue to play a part in Mexico's drug trafficking landscape, including connections with top Mexican military and political elites.",

It joined with several smaller leftist groups to establish the EPR as its armed wing in 1994. This was the same year that the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN), another guerrilla movement in the same region, launched their armed rebellion against the state.The EPR publicly announced itself in 1996, when some 100 armed men entered the town of Aguas Blancas, in Guerrero state, on the anniversary of the police's massacre of 17 farmer peasant protesters there. They read out a political manifesto calling for the overthrow of the government, citing inequality and violent repression, and fired 17 pistol shots to commemorate the dead.In the months after their 1996 public emergence, the EPR carried out a series of attacks against the police and military in Guerrero state. One of these attacks was an assault on a military base near Los Encinos which the EPR claimed killed more than 30 soldiers, though the authorities put the number of dead at below five. In August of the same year, the EPR carried out a series of coordinated attacks, including assaults on military bases, police stations, a radio station and towns in Oaxaca, leaving at least 17 dead.In 1998, a more radical faction led by Jacobo Silva, alias ""Commander Antonio,"" split off from the EPR, calling itself the Insurgent People's Revolutionary Army (ERPI).There was a lull in activity for several years, before the EPR launched a spate of attacks on gas and oil pipelines in Central Mexico and Veracruz in July and September 2007. The EPR claimed responsibility, saying that they were carrying out the attacks as a protest over the disappearance of two of their members who had gone missing in Oaxaca in May of that year, and added that they would avoid causing injuries.The group says that members Gabriel Alberto Cruz Sanchez and Edmundo Reyes were forcibly disappeared by federal forces, though the government denies knowing their whereabouts. The group has continued to agitate over their case, threatening in November 2012 to resume attacks until the men are located.","The EPR is led by five commanders whose full names are unknown, and the ERPI is led by Jacobo Silva, alias ""Commander Antonio"".","The EPR's main areas of operation are Guerrero, Oaxaca and Chiapas. The group has also been reported to have a presence in Guanajuato, Hidalgo, Michoacan, Morelos, Puebla, Queretaro, Tlaxcala, Veracruz and the Federal District (Mexico City).","The EPR has expressed its support for the Zapatistas, though the Chiapas-based group has denied any connection, and has renounced violent methods. There have also been reports of the EPR making contact with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).Following the disappearance of 43 students in Guerrero in 2014, the ERPI declared war on the Guerreros Unidos, the criminal group allegedly responsible for the attack. The ERPI has been linked to self-defense groups in Guerrero.","There were reports of peace talks between the rebels and the government in 2008, but these soon fell apart. The EPR is still cited as a threat by Mexican authorities, who warned in 2012 that it was rearming and reorganizing. The navy reportedly cited the threat posed by the EPR and the ERPI as justification for setting up nine new military bases on Mexico's southern border in 2009, and warned that the groups were obtaining heavy weapons trafficked from Guatemala. The group has also been accused of getting funds by carrying out kidnappings for ransom.",
Juárez Cartel,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/juarez-cartel-profile/,Juárez Cartel,,./images/organizations/juárez-cartel.jpg,2020-07-10,"['juarez cartel', 'mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"The Juárez Cartel is responsible for smuggling tons of narcotics from Mexico into the United States throughout its long and turbulent history, and the group's intense rivalry with the Sinaloa Cartel helped turn Juarez into one of the most violent places in the world.","The Juárez Cartel is one of the oldest and most powerful criminal organizations in Mexico. Since its beginnings, the cartel has focused on drug trafficking, but has expanded into other criminal activities such as human trafficking, kidnapping, local drug distribution and extortion. Based in the city of Juárez in the state of Chihuahua, northern Mexico, the Juárez Cartel is also known as the Vicente Carrillo Fuentes Organization (VCFO), after its leader.The origins of the Juárez Cartel go back to the 1980s, when the Ciudad Juarez area was under Rafael Aguilar Guajardo's control. Aguilar Guajardo worked closely with the Guadalajara Cartel, and after the arrest of the cartel's leader, Miguel Ángel Félix Gallardo, he was granted control of Juárez. Amidst mysterious circumstances, Aguilar Guajardo was killed in Cancún in 1993. His lieutenant, Amado Carrillo Fuentes, alias ""El Señor de los Cielos,"" quickly assumed control.The organization grew exponentially under Carrillo Fuentes. More prone to negotiate than fight, Carrillo Fuentes reconstructed Félix Gallardo's old network and more. Eventually, he controlled at least half of all Mexican trafficking and even extended his operations to Central America and into South America, including Chile and Argentina. Carrillo's alias, ""Lord of the Skies,"" aptly described his method: using commercial and parcel traffic, the Juárez Cartel moved thousands of tons of Colombian cocaine into Mexico by air, then into the United States by land. Carrillo Fuentes furthered his reach by establishing his own distribution networks in the U.S. He died, abruptly, in 1997, while getting plastic surgery, leaving behind a well structured cartel but a void at the top.Amado's brothers, Vicente and Rodolfo, took over but a power struggle quickly ensued. After some infighting, the two brothers, and their nephew Vicente Carrillo Leyva, established a firm command. In 2002, they allied with Juan José Esparragoza Moreno, alias ""El Azul,"" a former member of the Mexican Federal Judicial Police; Ismael Zambada, alias ""El Mayo""; the Beltrán Leyva brothers; and Joaquín Guzmán Loera, alias ""El Chapo."" Authorities called them the ""Federation,"" but the partnership would not last. After Rodolfo killed two of Guzmán's associates for not paying him to use the Juárez corridor, Guzmán gathered his allies and told them simply that Rodolfo, alias ""El Niño de Oro,"" had to die. Faced with a choice, Guzmán's partners chose him. Rodolfo was killed with his wife as they walked out of a movie theatre in September 2004. Guzmán's brother, Arturo, was killed just a few months later. The war was on, and Mexico still has not recovered.The Juárez Cartel has a large and longstanding transportation, storage and security operation throughout the country. It counts on its ability to co-opt local and state law enforcement, especially the judicial or ministerial police (detectives) and the municipal forces. It has long collected a tax for letting groups use its ""plaza,"" or drug trafficking corridor, and relied on alliances to operate nationwide. But the new modus operandi in the country, that of using small, more sophisticated armies to control swaths of territory, has made it hard for this group to compete. While its two main gangs, La Línea and the Aztecas, are formidable, they have had difficulty keeping pace with their competitors that work for the Sinaloa Cartel. La Línea, which does the street-level enforcement, has been particularly hard hit. Ciudad Juárez saw a decline in murders in 2011, with homicides dropping to a two-year low in May, which some attribute to the diminishing power of La Linea. The enforcement arm, like other failing drug traffickers, may have made an alliance with the Zetas. However, some analysts have suggested that it is the Juárez Cartel which is in decline and La Línea which is ascendant.The Juarez Cartel has also created the Linces, a group made up by approximately 80 deserters from the Army's Special Forces, who are in charge of protecting cartel members and transporting drugs.Today, the Juárez Cartel is still battling rival groups in its traditional stronghold around Ciudad Juárez. More than 1,200 homicides were committed there in 2018 alone, marking the first time the border city had recorded more than 1,000 murders since 2011, when the Juárez and Sinaloa cartels were deadlocked in a bloody war for control of the strategic border town.The current violence is likely driven by the Juárez Cartel’s splinter factions, as well as the local street gangs that such groups use as enforcers and soldiers in order to secure territory for small-scale drug dealing, as well as trafficking larger shipments across the border.In November 2019, the La Línea faction of the Juárez Cartel was linked to the brutal massacre of nine dual US-Mexican citizens from a cross-border Mormon community. The killings put a spotlight on how these so-called “small armies,” or the groups like La Línea that emerged as part of the outsourcing of security by Mexico’s most dominant cartels, have surged to play a critical role in controlling territory for larger groups.","In recent years, the Juárez Cartel has fragmented into smaller splinter factions like La Línea, who appear to play more of a role in controlling territory formerly held by the group.Luis Carlos Vázquez Barragán, alias “El 20,” was leading the faction and allegedly taking direct orders from Carrillo Fuentes before his death, helping the Juárez Cartel move large drug shipments across the US-Mexico border, as well as planning and carrying out targeted assassinations. However, Mexican authorities arrested him in Chihuahua in 2010.Since then, it’s not immediately clear who holds the top position within La Línea’s ranks.","At the height of its power, the cartel operated in nearly 21 states and its main areas of influence included Sinaloa, Durango, Jalisco, Coahuila, Zacatecas, Michoacán, Colima, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Veracruz, Chiapas, Campeche, Yucatán, Quintana Roo, Puebla, Morelos and Mexico City.The cartel maintains a firm foothold in Ciudad Juárez and the Valle de Juárez, which remains the key corridor for transporting illegal drugs into the United States. It still has some measure of control over the local and state police, as well as some politicians. It has turned to local gangs to be its enforcers, changing the dynamic in the area and increasing violent confrontation with its rivals.","
Most recently, a bloody battle has resurged in the border state of Chihuahua between the Juárez and Sinaloa cartels, likely over control over key smuggling routes into the United States. A Sinaloa Cartel-linked group known as Los Salazar operating in Sonora state, and the Juárez Cartel-faction known as La Línea operating in Chihuahua state, have been battling each other heavily in recent years.Another group to emerge as of late and test the Juárez Cartel’s control along the border has been the Nuevo Cartel de Juárez. The group has allegedly allied with the Jalisco Cartel New Generation (Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generación -- CJNG) and helped them muscle into the area. That said, the Juárez Cartel’s La Línea faction and the Sinaloa Cartel’s Los Salazar faction appear to have far more influence than the newly arrived rivals.","Despite recent news reports about its decline, the Juárez Cartel remains one of the most powerful criminal organizations in Mexico and the region. Small cells carry out different types of operations ranging from transportation to distribution of drugs; street gangs, mostly in the north, act as the enforcement wing and are involved in human trafficking and kidnapping operations.That said, the Juárez Cartel as it was once known is a shadow of its former self. Fragmentation has dogged the group for the past few years, and it seems like the armed wings it developed for security purposes now have more sway in the border regions under the group’s control.",
Urabeños - Gulf Clan,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/urabenos-profile/,Urabeños - Gulf Clan,,./images/organizations/urabeños---gulf-clan.jpg,2022-11-08,"['colombia groups', 'colombia mafia', 'gaitanistas']",colombia,"The Urabeños, also known as the Gulf Clan (Clan del Golfo) and the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia – AGC), emerged from the ashes of Colombia’s paramilitary movement to become the dominant criminal force in Colombia, with a reach that spread across the country. However, under pressure from authorities, the hold that leadership has over local cells that form this national network is getting weaker, and the group stands on the precipice of splintering into independent factions.This process may only be further accelerated by the capture in October 2021 of the group's leader, Dairo Antonio Úsuga, alias “Otoniel,” by security forces in northern Colombia. While his control had been slipping for a few years under the pressure of a sustained manhunt, he remained an identifiable leader for the group, and his removal may trigger further fragmentation.","The Urabeños take their name from Urabá, a northwestern region of Colombia near the Panamanian border highly prized by drug traffickers as it offers access to the Caribbean and Pacific coasts from the departments of Antioquia and Chocó. The group also refers to itself as the Gaitanist Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Gaitanistas de Colombia – AGC) and are called the Gulf Clan (Clan del Golfo) by the Colombian government.The Urabeños' origins can be traced to notorious paramilitary warlord Vicente Castaño, who in 2006 broke away from the demobilization process of the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia – AUC), and rearmed a paramilitary unit with two of his lieutenants: the former commander of the AUC’s Calima Bloc, Ever Veloza Garcia, alias “HH,” and Daniel Rendón Herrera, alias “Don Mario,” the former finance chief of one of the wealthiest paramilitary factions, the Centauros Bloc.When Castaño was killed in March 2007, most likely after having been betrayed by HH, Don Mario inherited the network, and set to work recruiting former paramilitary fighters in Urabá, where his brother, Fredy, alias “El Aleman,” had commanded the AUC’s 2,000-strong Elmer Cardenas Bloc.Don Mario quickly assembled a fighting force of around 80 men and then monopolized this important drug route, taxing traffickers for every kilogram of cocaine that passed through his territory. By 2008, Don Mario was one of the richest and most-wanted traffickers in Colombia. He began to expand his empire, moving into southern Córdoba province, the Bajo Cauca region in northern Antioquia, and into Medellín, and the Urabeños soon clashed with rivals such as the Paisas, the Rastrojos and the Oficina de Envigado. Police blamed Don Mario’s organization for at least 3,000 homicides between 2007 and 2009.Don Mario was captured on a farm in rural Urabá in April 2009 by a team of 200 police commandos. Following his capture, the Urabeños fell under the control of Juan de Dios Úsuga, alias “Giovanni,” and Dario Antonio Úsuga, alias “Otoniel,” two brothers who had begun their underworld careers with the now demobilized guerrillas of the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL) before passing into the ranks of the AUC.The Úsuga brothers gathered other former EPL guerrillas turned paramilitaries, who formed the disciplined and capable military core of the Urabeños, the “Estado Mayor,” or board of directors. They launched a new expansion plan by sending trusted lieutenants from Urabá to take control of strategic drug trafficking real estate, preferably through alliances and agreements, but otherwise through violence.In January 2012, Giovanni, the mastermind of the Urabeños strategy, was killed during a police raid on a ranch in the department of Chocó, leaving Otoniel as the maximum leader. Despite this setback, the Urabeños expansion continued, and when the leader of their principal rivals, the Rastrojos, surrounded to the authorities in mid-2012, the path was clear for the group to become Colombia’s dominant criminal organization.The Urabeños' influence spread across the country, and soon the group controlled drug production zones, trafficking corridors and international dispatch points throughout north Colombia, along both the Pacific and Atlantic coasts and along the land border with Venezuela.To facilitate this expansion, the Urabeños also developed a new model of organized crime. While some of its cells were directly controlled, in other cases the group absorbed local criminal organizations into its network, which operated as semi-autonomous members of the Urabeños “franchise.”In 2015, the government launched a major offensive against the Urabeños known as ""Operation Agamemnon."" While the initial phase of the operation saw seizures of multi-ton shipments of cocaine and millions of dollars in assets, and the arrests of hundreds of Urabeños members -- its principal targets -- the Urabeños leadership, remained elusive.However, this began to change in phase two of Agamemnon, and in 2017 the Urabeños command nodes began to fall. In May, security forces captured Eduardo Ortiz Tuberquia, alias “El Indio.” In August, they killed Otoniel’s second-in-command, Roberto Vargas Gutiérrez, alias “Gavilán,” and then in November, they killed military boss Luis Orlando Padierma, alias “Inglaterra.” That same year, Colombian police stated that Agamemnon had dismantled ""half"" of the Urabeños, although that number is hard to quantify.With the pressure mounting, and following two years of tentative approaches, in September 2017, Otoniel offered to turn himself in and demobilize the Urabeños, even appearing in a public video appealing to the Colombian government.That offer was refused and Agememnon was expanded to a taskforce of 3,000 men in 2018. This maintained pressure certainly weakened Otoniel's control, who saw his closest advisors captured and killed, and his family targeted.
His brother, sister and cousin were all arrested and extradited to the United States between 2019 and 2021.After years of being on the run, Otoniel was captured in October 2021, in an operation in which involved more than 100 police officers and 500 soldiers. In May 2022, he was extradited to the United States and charged in New York for conspiring to manufacture cocaine and distribute it to the US. He pled not guilty.A day after he was extradited, the Urabeños carried out a show of strength across Colombia across 11 Colombian departments and 180 municipalities throughout the country. This display of force saw curfews imposed on villages, blockades across major highways, and left 24 civilians dead.In late 2022, the Urabeños indicated their willingness to participate in the Total Peace (Paz Total) plan put forward by Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, although it is uncertain if all of its disparate groups and factions would do so.","The Urabeños are primarily dedicated to transnational drug trafficking. Members of the leadership group are themselves international traffickers that manage their own routes. However, the network as a whole is less a drug cartel and more a service provider to independent drug traffickers. The group controls territories and regulates or runs the coca base market, escorting shipments along international trafficking corridors, ensuring access to or protection for processing laboratories, and providing storage and dispatch services in coastal and border regions.The Urabeños network model requires local cells to be financially self-sufficient. As a result, these groups have expanded into illegal mining, extortion and microtrafficking, and they run or take a cut of other criminal activities that take place in their territories.Amid underworld shake-ups in the wake of the demobilization of the FARC, Otoniel’s Urabeños have become embroiled in bitter turf wars with the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) guerrilla and ex-FARC Mafia groups.In 2020 and 2021, the group also became involved, albeit in a limited manner, in the ongoing scramble for cross-border criminal economies between Colombia and Venezuela, reportedly reaching some sort of alliance with their old enemies, the Rastrojos, to fight the ELN there. Their impact inside Venezuela, compared to the ELN or ex-FARC Mafia, has remained somewhat limited, however. Since this evolution happened in the final months of Otoniel's freedom, it is uncertain how much sway he had on this development.They also maintain a longstanding relationship with Italy's 'Ndrangheta mafia, created in the AUC days, which regularly moves large shipments of cocaine across the Atlantic.","The Urabeños established a mixed network model, in which approximately one-third of local cells were directly commanded by the leadership in Urabá, while the others were local criminal organizations that used the Urabeños name and were expected to provide services or follow strategic orders when called upon. The network is coordinated by a national command node based in their stronghold of Urabá, consisting of former EPL guerrillas-turned-paramilitaries that is led by Otoniel. However, this command node has been devastated by recent security forces operations, leaving Otoniel an increasingly isolated figure largely concentrated on his own survival.Otoniel was captured in northern Colombia in October 2021 and subsequently extradited to the United States.Following his extradition, the leadership of the Urabeños passed to Jovanis de Jesús Ávila Villadiego, alias ""Chiquito Malo.""Born in the Urabeños' heartland of Urabá, Chiquito Malo is a safe pair of hands after the blow that was Otoniel's capture. A former paramilitary member of the AUC until their demobilization in 2004, he was commander of the Urabá Central Structure, by which time he controlled the Urabeños' drug trafficking activities in the Gulf of Urabá, a key territory for shipping drugs to Central America and the United States.By 2015, he was considered to be one of the group's top leaders. In June of that year, the United States government issued a formal accusation, identifying him as one of the main leaders of the drug trafficking structure.When he ascended to the top position in 2021, there were doubts as to whether he could keep the Urabeños united. But so far, the group appears more resistant to fragmentation than previously thought.","The Urabeños franchise has a presence in at least 17 of Colombia’s departments, as well as internationally. The group's base and territorial stronghold is centered around the Gulf of Urabá in the departments of Antioquia and Chocó, and stretching into Córdoba. They have an extensive presence throughout the rest of these departments, as well as along the Caribbean coast, in the city of Medellín and in departments such as La Guajira, Santander, Valle del Cauca and Norte de Santander.The group also has a small presence in an around Cúcuta along the Venezuelan border.","The competition for territory sparked by the demobilization of the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC) has pitted the Urabeños against the smaller guerrilla group the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN). In the department of Chocó in particular, the rivals are involved in a bitter and bloody turf war.The new mafia forming from FARC remnants, meanwhile, has the potential to create both new allies and enemies, depending on whether the two sides perceive it to be in their interests to cooperate or compete for the territory left behind by the guerrillas. In some areas, notably Córdoba in the north, the Urabeños are reportedly working with ex-FARC mafia, while in others, such as parts of Antioquia they are violently clashing with them.Furthermore, in early 2018, there were signs of local criminal groups previously part of the Urabeños violently rebelling against the central command, raising the possibility of new enemies emerging from within the network. This may be linked to rumors that the Urabeños high command has been unable to pay some of its members due to security force operations and cash flow problems.In 2020 and 2021, it was reported that the group had made an alliance with its old enemies, the Rastrojos, to fight back against both the ELN and the ex-FARC Mafia at the Colombia-Venezuela border.The Urabeños’ drug trafficking operations has also seen the group build alliances with independent drug traffickers within Colombia and Mexican drug trafficking groups like the Sinaloa Cartel.In 2022, the group expressed its desire to be part of the Total Peace proposal tabled by President Gustavo Petro.","The leadership node that has coordinated the network from Urabá is almost certainly done following the arrest of Otoniel. His capture was followed by the arrests and deaths of numerous other leaders, some of which even surrendered. The breakup of the Urabeños model of a central leadership node coordinating dispersed factions and semi-independent local franchises now seems inevitable.However, no matter what happens to its leadership, the Urabeños cells on the ground will not disappear. They will continue to control key strategic criminal territories, offering services to drug traffickers and other criminal elites, and running their own localized criminal activities. Some may operate as the private armies of the Urabeños drug traffickers that currently head certain fronts, whereas others may become independent networks with leaders from within the local ranks.It remains to be seen whether the group, and how many of its franchises and sub-groups, will eventually take part in negotiations with Gustavo Petro's government."
Barrio Azteca,https://insightcrime.org/mexico-organized-crime-news/barrio-azteca-profile/,Barrio Azteca,,./images/organizations/barrio-azteca.jpg,2018-07-09,"['barrio azteca', 'mexico', 'mexico groups']",mexico,"The Barrio Azteca gang emerged in Texas prisons, later served as armed support to the Juárez Cartel, and has since evolved to control local drug trafficking in Juárez. The gang's highly organized nature has helped it gain membership on both sides of the border, and it could now be in a position to make the leap into large-scale transnational organized crime.","The Barrio Azteca gang, also known as ""Los Aztecas,"" was formed in the El Paso, Texas prison system in 1986. The gang expanded after 1996, due in part to increasing deportations of imprisoned Mexican criminals by the United States. By the early 2000s, the gang controlled prisons in Chihuahua, and has since continued to grow. According to US estimates, it had around 3,500 members in 2011. By 2013, it reportedly had up to 5,000 in the Juárez area alone and an estimated 3,000 in the United States. According to the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Barrio Azteca also has members in Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, and Texas authorities have reported a Barrio Azteca presence in New Mexico.As of March 2015, the organization's top leader was Eduardo Ravelo, who formed part of the FBI's Top Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list until he was arrested in July 2018. Ravelo was believed to issue orders for the organization in Juárez, to move back and forth across the US border, and to be responsible for a great deal of the violence that has wracked the border state. Much of the rest of the Barrio Azteca leadership is based in US jails, where leaders use telephones, the postal service and secret messages filtered to visitors to communicate with members on the outside. The Cereso jail in Juárez has also served as an important operational center for weapons and drugs smuggling, according to one former member.Beginning in the 2000s, Barrio Azteca started to assist Mexico's Juárez Cartel with operations, and the gang became an important element in the battle between the Juárez Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel for control of the city of Juárez. The Juárez Cartel's armed wing, ""La Linea,"" recruited members from Barrio Azteca to fight the Sinaloa Cartel in 2008, and many gang members were killed or arrested. The group also helped the Juárez Cartel to move people and drugs as well as to acquire weapons and vehicles.In 2010, Barrio Azteca members allegedly murdered 15 teenagers at a party, and later that same year, killed a US Consulate employee, her husband and the husband of another employee in Ciudad Juárez. The attacks brought down a great deal of pressure from the US government, which issued a federal indictment of 35 Barrio Azteca members in Texas in March 2011 on counts of extortion, murder, drug trafficking and money laundering. Ten of these members were specifically indicted in connection with the 2010 Consulate case. Of the 35 indicted, 33 had been arrested and 26 had been convicted as of March 2015. The mastermind behind the murders, Arturo Gallegos Castrellon, received a life sentence in April 2014.Despite US efforts, the gang has apparently regained strength, and maintains significant power in Juárez, particularly as the power of the Juárez Cartel has declined. According to the US Department of Justice, Barrio Azteca profits by moving heroin, cocaine and marijuana across the border. The gang also controls local drug distribution, extortion rackets and human smuggling in Juárez, and uses other smaller, local gangs for manpower, as well as charging other criminals to operate in its territory. Drug distribution is believed to represent over half of the gang's revenue.Barrio Azteca also draws recruits from Juárez jails who are attracted by the strict order that the gang enforces on members. The gang, which refers to itself as the ""Familia Azteca,"" requires members to prioritize gang activities over all else and has a set of ""sacred rules,"" the breaking of which is grounds for harsh punishment and even death for gang members and their families.According to the February 2014 testimony of one jailed Azteca member serving as a witness in the trial of former leader Arturo Gallegos, members of the gang have received training from the Zetas in assassination, extortion and security. Some of these trainings took place further south of the border, in Torreon, Coahuila, indicating the group has expanded its reach into Mexico and is building its connections.The power of Barrio Azteca in Juárez puts it in an advantageous position. The group has control over other local gangs, has members across the border, and already moves drug shipments across the border. All of these factors create a very real possibility that, if the gang were to gain control over US-bound drug shipments moving through Juárez, Barrio Azteca could move into full-blown international drug trafficking.","The gang operates with a hierarchical structure similar to that of the army. A committee of ""generals,"" both in and out of prison rule by consensus. Below them, captains control mini-plazas that are run by lieutenants. These command sergeants, who are not always fully-fledged members, and finally soldiers, or ""indios,"" who are often underage and are used for the local distribution of small amounts of drugs. In addition, the gang has reportedly fixed some tactical errors that put it at an initial disadvantage, including beginning to use older model vehicles to maintain a lower profile and providing better training to its members.","The states of Juárez and Chihuahua in Mexico; El Paso, Texas; Massachusetts; Pennsylvania; possibly New Mexico.","The gang's key ally is the Juárez Cartel and its armed wing, La Linea. Barrio Azteca also works with the Zetas. A principal enemy is the Sinaloa Cartel, along with its subcontractor, the Mexicles gang.","The gang's control over Juárez puts it in a position to move into major transnational drug trafficking. The group already controls local drug distribution, smuggles drugs across the border, and has members in Texas, providing it with essential connections to expand operations. However, the 2018 arrest of Ravelo, the gang's reputed top leader, suggests authorities are aware of the threat posed by the group and are working to confront it.While Barrio Azteca remains the dominant gang in El Paso, it lost in power in the city in 2014 as the Juárez Cartel continued to decline, according to the 2014 Texas Gang Threat Assessment, and a competitor gang called Sureño 13 grew as a result of a relationship with the Sinaloa Cartel. Nevertheless, the FBI’s 2015 National Gang Report says Barrio Azteca remained one of the most active gangs in the US border region, and will likely remain a major criminal actor for the foreseeable future.",
FBL/FPLN,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/fbl/,FBL/FPLN,,./images/organizations/fbl-fpln.jpg,2019-07-15,"['fbl', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"The Patriotic Forces of National Liberation (FPLN) is a guerrilla group based in western Venezuela, along the border with Colombia. It is also commonly known by its previous acronym: the Bolivarian Liberation Forces (FBL). Unlike traditional insurgencies, the FBL/FPLN has generally supported the government of Venezuela and has avoided confrontations with security forces.","The FBL’s origins are unclear. While some analysts believe the group was founded by a radical leftist faction of the Fatherland for All Party (PPT), the PPT has denied any links to the guerrillas. Others believe that it emerged from the Communist Party of Venezuela (PCV) in the late 1980s.The FBL first gained prominence in Venezuela in 1992, when it claimed responsibility for several attacks on public officials who were widely perceived as corrupt. The most high-profile of these was the September 1992 assassination attempt against the president of the Venezuelan Confederation of Workers (CTV), Antonio Rios. However, they were not directly involved in Chavez’s failed coup attempt against the government of Carlos Andres Perez that same year.After fading from the limelight during the 1990s, the FBL re-emerged after Chavez was elected in 1999. In 2002, the group distributed flyers declaring support for the president, causing some to suspect that the group was revived with the help of the Chavez administration.  Both the guerrillas and government officials denied this, however, and Chavez himself publicly condemned the FBL’s activities as contrary to his “Bolivarian revolution.”Although allegations of direct collusion between the FBL and the Chavez administration are disputed, Chavez’s more lax approach to the policing of irregular armed groups allowed the FBL to formalize some of its operations and establish a political wing known as the Bolívar and Zamora Revolutionary Current (CRBZ). Tensions emerged in the FBL between those who supported the Chavez presidency and those who wanted to push for more radical social change.Around 2008, internal disputes caused the group to split. According to journalist and FBL/FPLN expert Sebastiana Barráez, the faction that kept the acronym FBL continued to operate for some time from strongholds in La Guaira, conducting attacks and propaganda campaigns in Caracas, but now appears to be relatively inactive.The other major faction adopted a more political course, maintaining tight relations with the CRBZ and taking the initials FPLN, seeking to distance itself from the extortion and terror tactics of its past. This faction continues to be active in the border states of western Venezuela, where they are commonly known as “Boliches”.","According to the Venezuelan military, the FBL was led by an individual known as Jeronimo Paz, and a five-member commanding body headed by aliases “Zacarias,” “Macaebo,” “Ernesto Guevara,” “Julian” and “Carlos Chileno.”Following the group’s split, the faction commanded by Jeronimo Paz became the FPLN. Barráez states that the faction commanded by alias “Zacarias” retained the acronym FBL, although this group’s profile is now very low, prompting speculation that it has disbanded or reintegrated with the FPLN. Little is known about the remaining commanders.The National Coordinator of the FPLN’s civilian wing, the CRBZ, is Kevin Rangel.","The FPLN is believed to have between 1,000 and 4,000 members, and is active mostly in the western border states of Apure, Táchira and Barinas. They have traditionally used the densely forested San Camilo and Ticoporo nature reserves as their main hideouts. In recent years, however, they have operated increasingly openly across the state of Apure, particularly in the Páez municipality.The guerrilla group funds itself mainly by extorting local landowners and businesses along the border with Colombia. In 2011, for instance, the FPLN reportedly charged a group of oil workers in Apure a “protection fee” of 110,000 bolivars, or about $25,000. Currently, locals report that the group controls the cattle business throughout Apure by extorting local ranchers. It uses river crossings to smuggle cattle and gasoline from Venezuela to Colombia: a business that has become increasingly lucrative since Venezuela’s descent into economic turmoil. The group has also been involved in the extortion of migrants, charging large sums of money to guarantee safe passage to those crossing the José Antonio Páez International Bridge.","Its financing activities have at times put the FBL/FPLN in conflict with Colombia’s National Liberation Army (ELN), which also operates on the border. It has had close relations with the larger Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), which has provided the FBL/FPLN with logistical support and training, although it is unclear whether it retains ties with the FARC dissidents following the Colombian peace process.The FPLN’s control of criminal economies has been facilitated by its ties with security forces and public officials in Apure. The CRBZ has considerable political influence in the state, controlling several communal councils and mayoral offices and maintaining a close relationship with Apure state governor Ramón Carrizalez. Although the CRBZ portrays itself as a peasants’ rights movement, it remains tightly linked to the FPLN and profits from its criminal economies.","The group is unusual among guerrilla movements in that it benefits from close ties to the current government. As such, its prospects are intimately linked to the durability of the Bolivarian system that endorses its public ideology and protects its access to criminal economies.In the post-Chavez period, as pressure has mounted on Venezuela, the group has shown itself willing to put its knowledge of guerrilla tactics at the service of the Maduro administration.

BACRIM in Venezuela,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/bacrims-in-venezuela/,BACRIM in Venezuela,,./images/organizations/bacrim-in-venezuela.jpg,2015-04-07,"['águilas negras', 'gaitanistas', 'rastrojos', 'venezuela', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"Various criminal groups made up of former Colombian paramilitaries, known as BACRIM, are present in Venezuela, using the country to run drug trafficking operations, process cocaine, and stash drugs and arms. Venezuela also serves as a hideout for their leaders, many of whom have been arrested in the country in recent years.","The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC) was an alliance between dozens of paramilitary groups that trafficked drugs, terrorized civilians, and waged war with the Colombian rebel groups the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN). Despite their right-wing ideology, the AUC originally praised the election of Hugo Chavez in 1998, sending him a congratulatory letter, which stated that ""as a military man"" Chavez would likely ""put things in order"" in Venezuela. However, the AUC's rhetoric would soon change completely, and they publicly labeled the Venezuelan president a""defender"" of Colombian guerrilla groups.Paramilitary warlord Salvatore Mancuso has testified that the AUC met with anti-Chavez factions in the Venezuelan military on two occasions to discuss carrying out military actions against the government.Among the first paramilitaries to run sizable drug trafficking operations in Venezuela were Miguel Angel Mejia Munera and his brother Victor Manuel, known as ""Los Mellizos"" (The Twins), who controlled cocaine exports from the Venezuelan states of Sucre, Bolivar, and Delta Amacuro. They became formally allied with the AUC in 2001, leading the Vencedores de Arauca Bloc. Los Mellizos were among the first narco-paramilitaries to be targeted by Venezuelan authorities, with the launch of Operation Orinoco in 2000, which was intended to disrupt their drug trafficking operations.Aside from controlling drug trafficking across certain parts of the border, and the contraband petrol trade, the AUC caused the displacement of tens of thousands of refugees into Venezuela. One faction, the Catatumbo Bloc in Norte de Santander province, would regularly kill civilians on the Colombian side of the border and dump the bodies in Venezuela to delay investigations.The AUC formally demobilized between 2004 and 2006, but its successor groups, the BACRIMs, remain active in some parts of eastern Venezuela. The Aguilas Negras were among the first BACRIM whose activity was registered in Venezuela. This BACRIM is not considered to be a centralized criminal organization, but rather networks of former AUC members who use the name ""Aguilas Negras"" to threaten land and labor activists, and commit other crimes. The name first appeared in Colombia's Norte de Santander province circa 2006.As was the case in Colombia, the Aguilas Negras announced their presence in Venezuela via a series of pamphlets distributed in Tachira state in 2008 and 2009, promising a campaign of ""social cleansing."" These pamphlets were accompanied by several violent incidents, including the kidnapping and murder of ten amateur Colombian soccer players in October 2009. The case was never solved, but it raised tensions between Colombia and Venezuela about ""spillover"" violence. The Aguilas Negras then began running extortion networks and kidnapping cells, and established assassins-for-hire in Tachira. In some towns, they even allowed residents to take out a life insurance policy on themselves to avoid assassination. According to the state police director, the Aguilas Negras, the Rastrojos, and the Urabeños all have a presence in Tachira. Of these, the Rastrojos were once the biggest player, controlling criminal operations along the 2,000 kilometer Venezuela-Colombia border, although they did not have as many operatives deployed there as the ELN and the FARC. According to Colombian think tank Nuevo Arco Iris, the Rastrojos controlled Zulia state, including the city of Maracaibo. In collaboration with Mexican cartel the Zetas, the Rastrojos used Maracaibo port and hidden airstrips for cocaine exports overseas. However, the Rastrojos' influence in Venezuela has been in decline as they have lost much of their leadership to captures and arrests, as well as lost ground in their war with Colombia's other main criminal group, the Urabeños.Police and locals have reported that the Urabeños have now established camps in Venezuela where they train recruits, use the border region to dispose of murdered Colombians, and have even recruited Venezuelans. Murders in the region have been attributed to a group calling themselves the Urabeños Fronterizos (Border Urabeños).","Numerous former paramilitaries and drug traffickers have found refuge in Venezuela. Ex-AUC leader Hector German Buitrago, alias ""Martin Llanos,"" who headed powerful paramilitary faction the Autodefensas Campesinas del Casanare, was arrested in Anzoategui state in February 2012. Oscar Ospino Pacheco, alias ""Tolemaida,"" the former head of the Northern Bloc and the right-hand-man to paramilitary leader Rodrigo Tovar Pupo, alias ""Jorge 40,"" was arrested in Miranda state in December 2009. Other Colombian drug traffickers arrested in Venezuela include Maximiliano Bonilla, alias ""Valenciano,"" Daniel Barrera, alias ""El Loco,"" and Diego Perez Henao, alias ""Diego Rastrojo.""","According to Venezuelan authorities, BACRIM are carrying out kidnappings, extortion, and drug trafficking in the border states of Tachira, Apure, and Zulia.","The Rastrojos and the Urabeños have clashed in a bid for control of the border state of Tachira for the past few years. Since 2013, however, there have been signs that the Urabeños have taken control there and in the neighboring Colombian city of Cucuta, giving them access to a primary route for smuggling not only drugs but also other contraband, including gasoline.","Unlike the FARC and the ELN in Venezuela, the BACRIM are not tolerated by the Venezuelan government and have been blamed for violence in the border region. Venezuelan authorities complain that Colombian BACRIM are destabilizing the country.",
ELN in Venezuela,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/eln-in-venezuela/,ELN in Venezuela,,./images/organizations/eln-in-venezuela.jpg,2020-01-28,"['eln', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"Colombian guerrilla group the National Liberation Army (Ejército de Liberación Nacional – ELN) has used Venezuelan territory for decades, but its presence in the country has become increasingly important since 2000 as its Colombian operations have been squeezed by paramilitary groups and security forces.This coincided with the arrival of former Venezuela President Hugo Chávez in 1999. Chávez’s rise to power and his idea of ​​a socialist model for Venezuela was the ELN’s entry point. The political platform of the late president shared similar ideas with the ELN. This would eventually benefit the ELN and other guerrilla groups in Colombia.After the demobilization of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia – FARC) in 2017, the ELN increased its presence on Venezuela-Colombia border, taking over territories and criminal economies previously controlled by the FARC. This spurred a rapid expansion of the group through Venezuela, particularly in the southern mining region. Today, the ELN is present in half the states of the country and controls vital economic resources.Venezuela’s current conditions have exacerbated a government crisis that has boiled over alongside rising crime rates and the penetration of organized crime into the highest levels of the government. The Andean nation has not only become a mafia state, but has sought alliances with groups like the ELN in the midst of such institutional chaos.","The ELN has used Venezuelan territory at least since the 1970s, when an army push against the group in Antioquia province — Operation Anori — almost destroyed its leadership, forcing the group to move its main power base to Arauca, on the Venezuelan border. From that time onwards, the ELN came to establish a presence in the neighboring Venezuelan state of Apure.Initially, Venezuelan governments were hostile to the rebels, particularly following the 1995 massacre of eight Venezuelan marines by the ELN in Apure. But from his election in 1999, Hugo Chávez displayed a friendlier attitude towards the ELN and the FARC, generally tolerating their presence in the country. This new climate, combined with increasing pressure from security forces, paramilitary groups and the FARC in Colombia, meant that the ELN’s presence in Venezuela became increasingly significant from 2000 onwards.With the signing of the peace accords and subsequent demobilization of FARC units in 2017, the ELN had the opportunity to consolidate with greater strength along the Venezuelan border, finding a footing in many territories and criminal economies previously controlled by the FARC.As well as tightening control in its traditional Venezuelan strongholds of Apure and Táchira, the ELN spread north into Zulia, and south into Amazonas and Bolívar. Control over the border secured the group’s access to profitable drug trafficking and smuggling routes, and persuaded embattled President Maduro of the group’s potential usefulness as a buffer against foreign invasion.Equally significant was the group’s rapid expansion through the mining region of southern Venezuela. The guerrillas cut a swathe through the mining arc, seizing control of illegal mines from local mafias and extending the ELN’s influence all the way to Venezuela’s eastern frontier. Their control of gold, coltan and diamond deposits not only swelled the guerrillas’ coffers, but also gave them powerful leverage with the bankrupt Venezuelan regime. Today, local opposition and indigenous leaders allege that the ELN actively collaborates with security forces and the Venezuelan national government to impose discipline on mining communities and ensure a constant flow of mineral rents.The ELN exerts a high level of social control in its areas of operation. It acts as a de facto State power in its strongholds in Táchira, Apure and Amazonas – administering justice, imposing curfews and punishing those who violate its norms. The group also holds significant sway with local political authorities. In some regions, members have even been observed distributing the subsidized food boxes from the government program known as the Local Storage and Production Committees (Comités Locales de Abastecimiento y Producción – CLAP), using this as a type of propaganda to influence the civilian population.All this suggests that Venezuela is now much more than a strategic rearguard area for the ELN. As the group continues to expand throughout the country, recruiting desperate young Venezuelans and demonstrating its usefulness to the Maduro administration, it can increasingly be considered a Colombo-Venezuelan rebel army.","The ELN’s leadership is concentrated in the Central Command (Comando Central – COCE), historically made up of five people. However, each of the various regional commanders has high levels of operational autonomy. Several have close ties to Venezuela.Eastern Front commander and COCE member Gustavo Anibal Giraldo Quinchia, alias “Pablito,” is said to live in Apure. Sources told InSight Crime that Pablito’s ranch had been seized from its previous owners by the government. Pablito has long been among the ELN’s most belligerent commanders, and is believed to have masterminded the attack on the Bogotá police training school in January 2019 that effectively ended the ELN’s negotiations with the Colombian government.The leadership of the Eastern Front has remained fairly intact since the early 2000s. It includes alias “Lenin,” who has been named by Colombian intelligence documents as the primary link between the ELN and the Maduro government.Other members of the COCE also use Venezuela as a hideout, from where they send orders and messages back to units in Colombia. Rafael Sierra Granados, alias “Ramiro Vargas,” is believed to be based in the state of Miranda. Eliécer Erlinto Chamorro, alias “Antonio Garcia,” has previously been located in Apure and Zulia and allegedly maintains strong links to the Maduro government.Another ELN member that may also be in Venezuela is Northeastern Front member, alias “Ariel.” It’s possible he coordinated part of the latest ELN attacks in Colombia along with Pablito. However, information about Ariel is still unclear. While unconfirmed, it’s believed that he operates in Colombia’s La Guajira near the border with Venezuela.","The ELN’s criminal economies and armed presence in Venezuela are concentrated in the states of Zulia, Táchira, Apure, Amazonas and Bolívar. Over the last three years, the group has maintained and strengthened its presence along the Colombian border, allowing it to control cross-border drug and contraband flows and recruit new members from among Venezuelan migrants. Simultaneously, it has undertaken a precipitous expansion through the mining regions of Amazonas and Bolívar, laying claim to mineral deposits and strategic river routes. The group now controls a wide corridor across the south of the country, all the way to the Guyanese border.As the ELN consolidates its presence in Venezuela, it is also reported to be establishing bases and strengthening its forces in Barinas, Guárico, Lara and Falcón. The Sierra de San Luis, on the border between Lara and Falcón, is believed to be a region of strategic expansion for the group, serving as a base for clandestine airstrips and a potential springboard to the Caribbean coast.ELN emissaries have also been observed in Anzoátegui, Trujillo and Portuguesa. Rumors that it the group is looking to establish bases in Yaracuy and Delta Amacuro have not yet been confirmed.","The ELN has been tolerated by Venezuelan authorities for years, and there are signs that the Maduro government increasingly sees it as a strategic ally in the face of mounting international pressure. The group is able to operate with near-total impunity thanks to its close ties with the security forces and local government in some parts of Venezuela’s border region, and in the Orinoco mining arc. While it is unlikely the ELN has been formally integrated into any Venezuelan defense strategy, there are signs that the Maduro government may be seeking closer collaboration with the group. Unconfirmed Venezuelan intelligence leaks suggest that military units are under instruction not to attack Colombian guerrilla groups on the border, but rather to provide them with logistical support.Although there have been several rumors about the relationship between the ELN and Venezuela’s Bolivarian National Guard (Guardia Nacional Bolivariana – GNB), the connection seems to be more one of criminal convenience and profiteering than a stable alliance. The groups collaborate in fuel smuggling operations in Apure, and ELN units pay a tax to the GNB in Amazonas and Bolívar for its “protection” of the illegal mines. However, the groups have also clashed over the division of criminal rents. Towards the end of 2018, the capture of alleged ELN Eastern Front commander Luis Felipe Ortega Bernal, alias “Garganta,” sparked a confrontation between the military and guerrillas that left four GNB members dead.Throughout the state of Bolívar, the ELN have clashed violently with the local mining mafias known as ""sindicatos,"" in order to seize control of illegal mines. Meanwhile, they are seeking alliances with Brazilian criminal groups to manage gold and drug trafficking routes into Brazil.The departure of the FARC from the criminal scene and the emergence of dissident former rebel fighters may provide a valuable ally for the ELN in Venezuela. A meeting between ELN high commanders and FARC dissidents reportedly took place in October 2018, in Venezuela’s Apure state. The two groups allegedly agreed upon a non-aggression pact and the distribution of drug trafficking routes. Today, relations between the two guerrilla groups on the ground remain cordial, and there are signs they may even be collaborating more closely in certain regions, such as the mines of Yapacana, Amazonas.The ELN’s most serious current conflict is with the Colombian guerrilla group, the Popular Liberation Army (Ejército Popular de Liberación – EPL), for control of cocaine production and trafficking in Catatumbo, on the border between Colombia and Venezuela. Although the conflict is rooted in Colombia, it has expanded into municipalities in the south of Zulia, Venezuela. The ELN has also clashed with the Rastrojos in Colón, southern Zulia, due to the entry of this paramilitary group into the region.","The ELN’s recent expansion in Venezuela has been driven by changing criminal dynamics following the demobilization of the FARC, escalating military offensives against ELN units in Colombia, and the tolerance if not active support of the Maduro government. All of these factors look set to continue.Although the Maduro regime does not officially recognize the ELN as an ally, his administration has welcomed the group’s presence in Venezuela and considers the guerrillas a strategic asset. As well as providing a shield on the Colombian border, criminal rents generated by the group are increasingly greasing the wheels of cash-strapped and corrupt local administrations and security forces. This is particularly the case in the mining arc, from where gold mined by the ELN is almost definitely feeding State coffers. Maduro’s increasing dependence on gold to keep his regime afloat is only likely to strengthen this relationship in the future.ELN commanders have publicly declared their willingness to defend the Maduro administration against any external aggression, claiming solidarity with the ideals of the “Bolivarian Revolution.” In reality, the situation is more complex: ELN units have considerable autonomy, and are motivated by their own criminal and ideological interests. But given the extent to which the ELN’s criminal empire has benefitted from Maduro’s compliant administration, the current context produces a powerful confluence between the group’s economic interests and its rhetorical position. It would therefore likely resist any transition government that came to power.The return to arms of several former FARC commanders in 2019 and the reconsolidation of ex-FARC mafia units on the Colombia-Venezuela border raises the stakes further. Although a re-empowered ex-FARC is weakening the ELN’s hegemony in some of its strongholds, so far there is no sign of renewed tensions between the two. Indeed, the groups appear to be seeking closer collaboration, raising the specter that they could present a united front in the face of any threat to the status quo in Venezuela.",
Ex-FARC Mafia in Venezuela,https://insightcrime.org/venezuela-organized-crime-news/farc-in-venezuela/,Ex-FARC Mafia in Venezuela,,./images/organizations/ex-farc-mafia-in-venezuela.jpg,2021-10-13,"['ex-farc mafia', 'farc', 'venezuela', 'venezuela groups']",venezuela,"Venezuela is a vital base of operations for dissidents from the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC).During the Colombian conflict, the country provided the guerrillas with key drug trafficking corridors, a place to escape pressure from Colombian security forces, carry out training and resupply with weaponry. Since the FARC demobilized in 2017 after rebel leaders signed a peace agreement with the Colombian government, Venezuela has continued to fulfill this role for the mafia comprised of deserters and dissidents from the peace process, offering them both an economic lifeline and a safe haven to regroup and reconsolidate their forces.","Venezuela was a site of operations for the FARC throughout much of the Colombian conflict, but its importance to the group increased exponentially after Hugo Chávez came to power in 1999, and after the rebels lost their government-granted safe haven in Colombia in 2002. This coincided with increased pressure from paramilitaries and from the Uribe government in Colombia (2002-2010), which combined to turn Venezuela into a crucial rearguard area for the rebels.During the Chávez presidency, there were accusations of collusion between the FARC and the highest levels of Venezuela’s government and armed forces, who allegedly provided the guerrillas with logistical support and arms. There is also strong evidence that the FARC collaborated in drug trafficking with the state-embedded trafficking cells collectively referred to as the Cartel of the Suns (Cartel de los Soles), leading to indictments against senior government figures in addition to the sanctions imposed by the US Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control on  top-level officials in government and the security forces for allegedly colluding with the FARC.The question of FARC encampments in Venezuela led to a major diplomatic row between former presidents Chávez and Alvaro Uribe. Colombian intelligence reports leaked in 2010 estimated that some 1,500 FARC rebels were active in 28 encampments in the Venezuelan border states of Apure and Zulia. In the final years of the Chávez presidency, however, Colombo-Venezuelan relations improved under Colombian president Juan Manuel Santos and Chávez’s abetment of the guerrillas appears to have waned.Between 2012 and 2016, the Venezuelan government played an important role as one of five guarantors in Colombia’s peace negotiations with the FARC, which concluded with the rebels demobilizing in 2017. However, Venezuela also become a refuge for FARC dissidents who refused to participate in the demobilization. Initially scattered and disorganized, these dissidents have regrouped and grown in number as the implementation of the accords faltered and their ranks have been bolstered by disillusioned former FARC members, forming what InSight Crime collectively refers to as the ex-FARC Mafia.There are now several different ex-FARC Mafia factions present in Venezuela. The state of Apure acts as headquarters for the Second Marquetalia, an ex-FARC network formed by some of the main FARC negotiators in the peace talks, who abandoned the process in 2018. This network is allied to the Acacio Medina Front. Also present in Venezuela are the 10th Front and the 33rd Front, both of which are smaller, semi-autonomous groups that are part of the biggest ex-FARC Mafia network in Colombia, which is coordinated by Miguel Botache Santillana, alias “Gentil Duarte.”Just as was the case during the Colombian conflict, Venezuela continues to offer the ex-FARC a safe haven and access to important criminal economies, above all drug trafficking but also illegal mining and contraband smuggling. In many cases, these networks have also maintained the FARC’s alliances with corrupt security forces and political actors, allegedly including senior figures in the regime of Chávez’s successor, Nicolás Maduro.However, these relationships are becoming ever more complex and fractious due to growing rivalries between the different ex-FARC factions and within the Venezuelan state. These tensions erupted into violence in early 2021 when the Venezuelan military launched an unsuccessful operation to drive the 10th Front out of Apure.","The Second Marquetalia is led by Luciano Marin Arrango, alias “Iván Marquez,” who is believed to be based in Venezuela. Marquez was the second most senior FARC leader prior to the demobilization and headed the rebels’ negotiating team. He founded the Second Marquetalia with Seuxis Pausías Hernández Solarte, alias “Jesús Santrich,” who also played a key leadership role until he was killed in the Venezuelan state of Zulia in May 2021.The Acacio Medina Front is led by Gener García Molina, alias “John 40,” who is also believed to be based in Venezuela.  John 40 was a senior FARC commander, who was heavily involved in the drug trade, but broke away from the rebels during the peace process. He initially formed part of the leadership group of Gentil Duarte’s dissident network until switching allegiance to the Second Marquetalia in early 2021.The 10th Front is led  by a former mid-level FARC commander Jorge Eliécer Jiménez Martínez, alias “Jerónimo” or “Arturo,” while the 33rd Front is commanded by Javier Alonso Veloza García, alias “John Mechas.” While both commanders are responsible for their groups’ day to day operations, they are believed to coordinate with the national dissident leadership group headed by Gentil Duarte.","The ex-FARC Mafia forces are heavily concentrated in the border region, although there have been reports of their presence as far into the country as the southeastern state of Bolívar.The Second Marquetalia is based in the state of Apure, from where the leadership coordinates with cells all across Colombia and maintains drug trafficking infrastructure. Its allies in the Acacio Medina Front are largely dispersed throughout the state of Amazonas, where it controls drug routes and illegal mining operations.The 10th Front controls a binational territory covering areas in Apure and the Colombian department of Arauca, where it profits from its control of border crossings. The 33rd Front is largely based in the drug trafficking hub of Catatumbo in the Colombian department of Norte de Santander, and initially only had a sporadic presence in Venezuela. However, in 2021, it began establishing a more permanent presence across the border in the state of Zulia, which is an important dispatch point for cocaine produced in Catatumbo.","In Colombia, the various factions of the ex-FARC Mafia are increasingly converging around two rival poles of influence: Gentil Duarte’s dissident network and the Second Marquetalia. After initial attempts to unify their forces, the relationship between the two sides has been increasingly acrimonious, which in Venezuela has been evident in the rivalry between the Second Marquetalia and the 10th Front in Apure.There is strong evidence to suggest the Second Marquetalia maintains ties to the government of Nicolás Maduro, who publicly stated that Iván Marquez and Jesús Santrich were “welcome” in the country after the pair abandoned the peace process. However, in contrast the government has labelled the 10th Front as “terrorists” and attacked the guerrillas, despite their evident ties to the Venezuelan military units stationed in the region.The rapid expansion of Colombia’s National Liberation Army (ELN) in Venezuela has put them in competition with the ex-FARC Mafia for lucrative drug-trafficking and smuggling routes on the Colombia-Venezuela border. It was reported in December 2018 that the FARC dissidents had agreed a non-aggression pact with the ELN and were working with them to coordinate illicit activities. However, since then there have been signs of tensions and even conflict between the ELN and certain factions of the ex-FARC, above all the 10th Front.The ex-FARC Mafia’s drug-trafficking activities in Venezuela are also facilitated by alliances with international criminal groups, such as Brazil’s Red Command (Comando Vermelho) and Family of the North (FDN), and Mexico’s Sinaloa Cartel.","The different factions of the ex-FARC Mafia in Venezuela facing increasingly divergent prospects in Venezuela. The Second Marquetalia, and its allies in John 40’s Acacio Medina Front will likely continue to enjoy high level support from elements within the Venezuelan state, granting them near impunity to build up their forces and run criminal economies. As the Second Marquetalia has struggled to rebuild in Colombia, this ability to operate in Venezuela may become ever more central to the network.However, the 10th Front is now operating in hostile terrain and will likely find its activities in Venezuelan increasingly curtailed. Similarly, the 33rd Front, which is also part of Gentil Duarte’s network, may encounter resistance to its attempts to expand in Zulia.",

The organization primarily handles drug transport operations, as well as the movement of precursor chemicals for methamphetamine production, weapons, and other contraband. The group primarily works as “transportistas” (transporters) for Colombian drug traffickers.","Nicaragua’s National Police have said that the Tarzanes’ origins date back to the mid-1990s, when they formed part of a network that included the now defunct Norte del Valle Cartel in Cali, Colombia. The Colombian cartel would ship cocaine to Panama, and the Tarzanas provided the go-fast boats and the crew needed to move the shipments from Costa Rica’s Limon province on the Caribbean coast across Lake Nicaragua. Mexican groups like the Gulf Cartel would eventually buy the cocaine shipments.The Tarzanes also used other maritime routes to move cocaine for the Norte del Valle Cartel. They have proved capable of distracting Nicaragua’s Naval Forces with methods that include deploying several go-fast boats at the same time, in order to protect the boat that is actually carrying the cocaine shipment.","Authorities in Costa Rica arrested Augustin Reyes Aragon, the alleged leader of the Tarzanes, in July 2014. Costa Rican officials involved in the investigation said Reyes Aragon led a group of traffickers that brought cocaine from Colombia and marijuana from Jamaica into the Costa Rican province Limon for storage, and then north to Honduras and Mexico, as well as for sale on the domestic market.Reyes Aragon has six brothers allegedly involved with the Tarzanes, one of whom likely took over after his arrest.","The Tarzanes are based along the southern Nicaragua border, primarily in San Juan de Nicaragua municipality. While the Tarzanes have long been thought to use Costa Rica as a refuge, an investigation from Costa Rica’s Judicial Investigation Department dating back to 2012 found the group increasingly uses the country as a base for its operations, perhaps due to increased Nicaraguan security patrols.The group reportedly used Calero Island -- a disputed territory between Costa Rica and Nicaragua -- as a transit point for drug trafficking, as well as several houses in the Costa Rican province of Limon. They have also been linked to drug trafficking cells in Honduras.","Reyes Aragon may have a powerful enemy in former Sandinista commander Eden Pastora, a well-known Nicaraguan figure who sparked a 2010 border dispute over Calero Island by dredging the nearby San Juan River. Reyes Aragon reported the presence of Nicaraguan security forces on the island, which neither country was supposed to enter, igniting an international incident and provoking Pastora’s wrath. Reyes later told Costa Rican authorties that Pastora hired hit men to kill him and should not be extradited to Nicaragua.The Tarzanes reportedly supply cocaine to the Gulf Cartel and the Sinaloa Cartel. ","Local transport gangs like the Tarzanes increasingly participate in the international drug trade as larger transnational organizations splinter and lose control over supply chains. Groups like the Tarzanes are also aided by Costa Rica and Nicaragua's increased importance as a transit nations in the regional drug trade, along with the inherent difficulties of policing a region as remote and inaccessible as Nicaragua’s Caribbean coast. Still, it remains to be seen how the Tarzanes will deal with Reyes Aragon’s arrest.",

The family was accused of hiring six assassins, including a Colombian and several former police officers, to kill law enforcement agents Juan Jose Funez, Ruth Gonzalez, Roger Ernesto Villachica and Johnny Dometz. The slain police were mostly likely seen as hindering drug shipments along the Caribbean coast. The Reñazcos have denied these accusations.","The head of the family is Miguel Angel Reñazco Padilla, imprisoned on drug trafficking charges until June 2, 2004, when he was apparently released for good behavior.Authorities in Costa Rica arrested him in the province of Limon in July 2013, for allegedly participating in the police massacre, and extradited him to Nicaragua in April 2014. In June, Reñazco was found guilty for the murders in Nicaragua.Other members of the family include Marcos Reñazco Padilla, José Ángel Padilla and Carlos Alberto Padilla Reñazco, who were captured in 2005 for smuggling drugs along the Rio San Juan, and who were wanted on charges of plotting the police massacre in Bluefields. In 2008, the three detainees were absolved and set free.","Based primarily in Nicaragua's South Atlantic Autonomous Region (RAAS), the Reñazco family is active in the department’s capital, Bluefields, as well as San Juan del Norte in the Rio San Juan department.","As a drug transport gang, the Reñazcos move drugs through Nicaragua primarily to sell to Mexican organizations like the Sinaloa Cartel and the Zetas.","The capture of Miguel Reñazco could represent a significant blow to the organization, but since the family manages to stay out of the local press, little is known about whether his arrest has impacted their operations.",

Their military background and unbridled ferocity proved an underworld game changer, with the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) describing them as perhaps ""the most technologically advanced, sophisticated and violent of these paramilitary enforcement groups.""The Zetas broke away from the Gulf Cartel in the mid-2000s to become its own group, and launched an offensive that would see them expand throughout Mexico and Guatemala. The group employed a new model of organized crime, based on violently seizing and holding territory, using fear rather than corruption as a first resort.However, after rising to the point where they could compete with the mighty Sinaloa Cartel, the Zetas are now a fragmented force, held together by little more than a name and increasingly dependent on local criminal revenues rather than the transnational flow of drugs for their income.","In 1997, 31 members of the Mexican Army's elite Airborne Special Forces Group (Grupo Aeromóvil de Fuerzas Especiales - GAFES) defected and began working as hired assassins, bodyguards and drug runners for the Gulf Cartel and its leader Osiel Cárdenas Guillén.

Under the leadership of Heriberto Lazcano, alias ""El Lazca"" or ""Z3,"" the Zetas, numbering approximately 300, set up their own independent drug, arms and human-trafficking networks.The Zetas' logistical sophistication and military training helped catapult the group to power. They became known for their use state-of-the-art weapons and communications technology, and for employing military-like discipline in planning operations and gathering intelligence.Unlike other cartels, the Zetas did not buy alliances so much as terrorize their enemies. They tortured victims, strung up bodies, and slaughtered indiscriminately, as was brutally illustrated in August 2010, when the Zetas killed 72 migrants and dumped their bodies in a hole in Tamaulipas. The Zetas preferred to take military-style control of territory, holding it through sheer force and exploiting its criminal opportunities. Although their military training was diluted over time, their brutality was not. Rival cartels struggling against the Zetas began to adopt some of their tactics, further ramping up violence in the country.By 2010, the Zetas had established a presence in 405 Mexican municipalities, over twice as many as their nearest rivals. They had also moved into Guatemala, seizing strategic drug trafficking territories with their trademark violence. However, they were in nearly constant war with the Gulf Cartel over control of the key border state of Tamaulipas, especially the cities of Matamoros, Reynosa and Nuevo Laredo, as well as the key economic hub of Monterrey. The Zetas also became embroiled in numerous other cartel wars across the country, including taking on the might of the Sinaloa Cartel.During this time, the Zetas built up a network of international drug trafficking contacts, stretching through Central America to Colombia, and with reported connections in Venezuela, Europe, the United States and West Africa. However, the territorial control of each local faction also allowed them to take their share from any other criminal activity taking place in their ""plaza,"" and the Zetas also began to profit from everything from kidnapping migrants to pirating DVDs. The group also began looking for political protection, and would go on to infiltrate state governments in states like Tamaulipas and Veracruz.Despite their rapid ascent, by 2012, the Zetas were beginning to crack, sparking a process of fragmentation and atomization that continues today. It was becoming increasingly difficult to coordinate all of the local factions centrally, but the fault line that would ultimately cause a split was the deteriorating relationship between the Treviño brothers, Miguel, alias ""Z40,"" and Alejandro, alias ""Omar"" or ""Z42,"" who divided into rival factions -- the Northeast Cartel (Cartel del Noreste) and the Zetas Old School (Los Zetas Vieja Escuela).The Zetas were further undermined by a steady series of high-profile blows to the leadership, the most serious of which was the loss of Lazcano, who was killed in October 2012 -- although the mysterious disappearance of his body shortly after sparked conspiracy theories he remains alive today. The Zetas also lost Miguel Treviño, who was arrested in July 2013, and his brother Alejandro, who was arrested in March 2015.With no clear national, centralized leadership, the Zetas have broken into splinter groups and largely independent local factions, each with their own operations, priorities and alliances. The breakup of the organization's national cohesion, in addition to a huge loss of influence in Central America, has made transnational drug trafficking increasingly difficult, and local factions now often rely more on profiting from crime in territories they hold than from international drug trafficking. Still, smaller, more localized cells that once assumed the Zetas’ brand continue to operate throughout much of the Zetas’ former territory.In February 2018, Mexican marines captured Zetas capo José María Guizar Valencia, alias “Z43."" Valencia allegedly operated in the states of Veracruz, Tabasco and Chiapas, along with overseeing drug shipments through Central America. The capture of Valencia is likely to cause further atomization within an already-fractured and weakened organization.Since 2019, a number of Zetas splinter groups have gained in strength. They are, however, a far cry from the original gang, with a strong regional presence but little chance of a national breakout across Mexico. The main one are the Old School Zetas (Zetas Vieja Escuela), based in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Coahuila, San Luis Potosi, Quintana Roo, and Zacatecas. However, the Talibanes are another major splinter group, fighting for control of drug trafficking routes through San Luis Potosi, Zacatecas, and Tamaulipas.","The Zetas as an unified criminal organization no longer exists. The group's fragmentation into several smaller splinter cells has made it increasingly difficult to identify those in leadership positions.A 2017 DEA report indicates that Z40's cousin Juan Gerardo Treviño-Chávez, alias “El Huevo,” is the most powerful leader of the highly-fragmented Zetas. Other sources have been more specific, stating that El Huevo currently serves as leader of the Northeast Cartel faction. Treviño-Chávez was arrested in Nuevo Laredo in March 2022, which provoked a wave of violence by Northeast Cartel forces. He was soon after extradited to the United States where he faces charges of drug trafficking.
","The Zetas criminal empire once had a presence that stretched across Mexico, with their stronghold stretching from Nuevo Laredo to Monterrey. Their reach also expanded into Central America, especially Guatemala. However, now the group is limited to Mexico and occupies a patchwork of territory across the country. The Zetas' most critical areas remain Tamaulipas and the Gulf Coast.","The Zetas have made numerous temporary alliances with groups such as the Familia Michoacana and the Beltrán Leyva Organization, as well as waging war against any number of rivals. However, two things generally remain the same: their rivalry with their former parent organization the Gulf Cartel, and their rivalry with the Sinaloa Cartel. Nevertheless, even this may be changing in the Zetas' current fragmented state where alliances and disputes are more localized.Internationally, the Zetas reportedly built alliances with criminal organizations in Colombia, Central America -- in particular Guatemala -- Venezuela, West Africa, Europe and the United States. It is unclear how much of this network now remains.","The Zetas’ days as Mexico’s most feared cartel and a drug trafficking organization with a vast transnational reach are now over. However, this does not mean the name will fade any time soon. Instead, they are likely to continue the process of fragmentation, and splinter cells like the Northeast Cartel and the Old School Zetas will continue to operate with an increasingly local focus on their criminal activities.",
Perrones,https://insightcrime.org/el-salvador-organized-crime-news/perrones-profile/,Perrones,,./images/organizations/perrones.jpg,2020-03-10,"['chepe luna', 'el salvador groups', 'perrones cartel']",el,"The Perrones are El Salvador’s most infamous transportation group. Made up of a mix of hoteliers, human smugglers and contraband traders, the group’s activities stretch from Panama to Guatemala. Working from their eastern front, along the border with Honduras, many of them carry dual citizenship with the neighboring country, which allows them to move easily across the porous borders they use to move their products. They appear to answer offers of many suitors, mostly Colombian and Mexican groups but also Guatemalan organizations, that move large quantities of drugs and other contraband north toward the United States and bulk cash south. Many of the Perrones’ leaders have been arrested and charged with various crimes, but the cases against them have fallen apart in El Salvador’s weak justice system.","Many of the Perrones’ bosses got their start smuggling the staples of everyday life into El Salvador from across the border in Honduras. Reynerio Flores, who grew up just a few miles from the border and was one of the gang’s foremost leaders before his arrest, began his career ferrying water into El Salvador by mule. Later, the men who would become the core of Los Perrones expanded into food and clothes, bringing them in not just from Honduras, but from as far south as Panama. Other gang leaders focused on moving contraband cheese, which earned them the nickname El Cartel de los Quesos.Of course, the reward for smuggling cocaine is much higher than for cheese, so the networks shifted focus to where the profits were higher. The logistical requirements for each type of smuggling are largely the same, so Los Perrones were a natural link between the Colombian cocaine producers and the Mexican gangs that became ever more important in the 1990s and 2000s. The Salvadoran networks began to work especially closely with the Sinaloa Cartel, which was also busy establishing itself as the Mexican group most active internationally.Rather than working to create Sicilian style dominance over the territories they control, Los Perrones, known locally as transportistas, are smugglers in the truest sense of the word. They are experts at moving merchandise through El Salvador and across the border into Honduras and Guatemala, for later transit to the Mexico and the United States. Typically, because of the small territory and underdeveloped airway system, they move drugs and other contraband through Central American via trucks.The overland transit comes after they initially collect the cocaine from Colombia and Ecuador, usually via go-fast boats or semi-submersible vessels, both of which can carry large shipments of drugs and are effective at evading authorities on the open sea. The illicit merchandise is typically offloaded onto legitimate-seeming vessels like fishing boats, in which it is brought into the country along the country’s narrow coastline.Their capacity to move merchandise from the open water to Central American highways makes them a valuable ally for the larger Mexican and Colombian gangs running drugs through the region, and they have developed ties with some of the most notorious gangs in the hemisphere, most notably the Sinaloa Cartel. Authorities say that the wealthier and more notorious Mexican gangs represent something of a role model for Los Perrones. In an effort to emulate their senior partners, they have embraced varying elements of Mexican narco-culture, from narcocorridos to a love of thoroughbred horses.Los Perrones also developed deep ties to Salvadoran government as they grew, penetrating local security agencies and political circles in the regions where they operate. The gangs are thought to be particularly close to officials in the eastern portion of the country, where the ARENA and National Conciliation Parties are prominent. In one notorious case, Flores avoided arrest and fled to Honduras after being tipped off by a police officer that his detention was imminent in El Salvador. (He was later arrested in Honduras.)","As a result of the increased attention, as well as infighting among different Perrones factions, many of the group’s original leaders -- Daniel Quezada, Reynerio Flores and Juan Colorado -- have been captured.Additionally, Jose Natividad Luna Pereira, alias ""Chepe Luna"" -- once the Perrones' most powerful leader -- was murdered in June 2014 in Honduras. A police operation in July 2014 also resulted in the capture of Jose Enrique Torres, who was believed to lead a remnant of the organization and work with members of the Barrio 18 gang. It remains to be seen how these events will impact the group's future.","As the group grew, it divided into two geographical subdivisions: Los Perrones Occidentales and Los Perrones Orientales. The former group controls the smuggling cocaine, arms, and migrants from western El Salvador overland into Guatemala. Los Perrones Orientales focus on bringing the cocaine in from South American via maritime routes, and send it over to their allies in western El Salvador or northward to Honduras.Los Perrones have a presence over a wide swathe of El Salvador’s small territory. Los Orientales operate out of cities like San Miguel, Usulutan, and La Union, while the Occidentales are concentrated around the city of Santa Ana.","The relationship between Los Perrones and the other dominant criminal element in El Salvador, the infamous Maras (Barrio 18 and Mara Salvatrucha), seems to be a fluid one. There have been reports of the two groups fighting for control over smuggling routes, but for the most part, the relationship seems to be complementary: with the Maras controlling territory in cities like San Salvador with mass numbers of members, and the Perrones located primarily in more peripheral cities and needing only periodic use of their transportation networks when shipments come through, the two are not constantly at odds. Indeed, Los Perrones often contract groups of Maras as muscle.","While the operated under the radar for many years, Los Perrones began to garner increased attention in the early 2000s, when several tons worth of cocaine shipments linked to the group were discovered in Nicaragua and Costa Rica. As a result of the increased attention, as well as infighting among different Perrones factions, many of the group’s original leaders -- Daniel Quezada, Reynerio Flores and Juan Colorado -- have been captured. In April 2019, Chepe Luna's brother, Ernesto Santos Luna, was sentenced to six years in prison for smuggling contraband. Nonetheless, Los Perrones have regrouped, and remain a major force in the nation’s underworld.",
Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/auc-profile/,Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC,,./images/organizations/autodefensas-unidas-de-colombia---auc.jpg,2015-11-17,"['auc', 'colombia groups']",colombia,"The United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC) was a coalition of right-wing death squads that used the conflict to camouflage their illicit economic activities. These included drug trafficking, displacement, kidnapping, and extortion. The AUC once operated in two-thirds of the country with approximately 30,000 soldiers.","The origins of the paramilitaries go back to the early 1980s, when drug traffickers, facing a wave of kidnappings by leftist guerrilla groups, decided to create a death squad they called Death to Kidnappers (Muerte a Secuestradores - MAS). This illegal group assassinated not just the kidnappers, but also any supposed member of the rebels' infrastructure, which included many innocent civilians, activists, union leaders and politicians. Later, ""self-defense"" groups emerged, some of them initiated by Colombian army officers and politicians who called for the population to organize in their own defense. Many of them were legally constituted. However, rather than protect civilians from the transgressions of the guerrillas, many of the groups simply worked for drug traffickers, at the behest of large landholders, or both. The alliance with these powerful economic interests gave paramilitary groups access to weapons, cars and communications equipment, but it distorted their original purpose.Indeed, the rise of the drug traffickers' economic power would change the face of the conflict. Powerful members of the Medellin Cartel invested heavily in land and, using the paramilitary groups, sought to shield themselves from the guerrillas' extortion and kidnapping attempts. MAS expanded exponentially in these rural areas. But soon the ""self-defense"" groups were protecting drug stashes and cargoes rather than civilians. These organizations also unleashed waves of violence against sectors of the population who were considered supporters of the guerrillas. Thousands of civilians were killed, including state agents and politicians, leading the government to criminalize the paramilitary groups.The criminalization of these groups coincided with a larger battle over extradition fought by the Medellin Cartel and its leader Pablo Escobar against the government. This fight eventually spread to other parts of his organization. When Escobar killed two of their close associates, Fidel Castaño and his brothers, Carlos and Vicente, teamed with Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" to form a group called People Persecuted by Pablo Escobar (Perseguidos por Pablo Escobar - PEPES). They used Carlos as their intermediary with the police, who worked closely with the paramilitary group to gun Escobar down in December 1993. Fidel mysteriously disappeared shortly thereafter. One story is that he died fighting the Popular Liberation Army (Ejercito Popular de Liberacion - EPL). Another is that Carlos killed him in a family dispute. In either case, the core of the paramilitary group that he and Don Berna had created remained.The second generation of paramilitaries came from the PEPES. The remnants of this group formed the Peasant Self-Defense Forces of Cordoba and Uraba (Autodefensas de Cordoba y Uraba - ACCU). In 1996, the ACCU created a loose federation of self-defense groups comprised of seven regional organizations known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). These paramilitary groups were able to establish local fiefdoms in the main areas of guerrilla influence and drive out the rural population that they accused of collaborating with the rebels.The AUC's emergence coincided with a shift in the drug trafficking industry. Following the destruction of the Medellin Cartel and the subsequent dissolution of the Cali Cartel, the market became segmented, giving rise to about 500 small micro-trafficking groups. Leftist guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) also began exerting more territorial control over areas where drug crops were harvested and drugs were produced. The result was near-inevitable conflict between the two remaining super-structures as the paramilitaries fought the guerrillas for control of the means of production of the drug crops, entering by force -- often with the support and assistance of the Colombian army -- and carrying out selective assassinations and massacres that generated massive displacement and widespread terror.The profits from their war spoils allowed the AUC to grow exponentially and create an army of more than 30,000 soldiers. But the source of this profit, principally drugs, placed the group in the crosshairs of the United States government, which sought to break up what had become arguably the largest drug trafficking organization in the world. Sensing a showdown and already facing a series of indictments in the US for drug trafficking, the paramilitaries sought a way out by negotiating a peace deal with the Colombian government.In 2020, InSight Crime published a new investigation, revealing how Guillermo León Acevedo Giraldo, alias ""Memo Fantasma,"" a former member of the AUC had been living in luxury in Madrid, Spain. He was arrested in June 2021.","The Castaño brothers are considered the founders of Colombia's paramilitary movement, but each of the regional groups that comprised the AUC also had its own leadership.","At the height of its power, the AUC operated in two-thirds of Colombia, with a particularly strong presence in the Caribbean Coast region, especially in Uraba, a region located in northwestern Colombia near the Panamanian border.","The AUC fought against the FARC for control of areas that were strategic in the drug trade, and targeted communities it believed to be loyal to the FARC, perpetrating massacres and other atrocities. At the same time, the AUC counted on the support of military and political officials.","Between 2003 and 2006, the AUC and the Colombian government hammered out a peace agreement, and numerous paramilitary fronts demobilized. The shortcomings of the process, however, were immediately apparent. The government lacked the infrastructure to verify who the demobilized paramilitaries were and whether they had turned in all their weapons. Some paramilitary groups deliberately duped the government, handing in old and poorly maintained weapons and conscripting civilians to pose as paramilitary soldiers.These groups began operating under new names even before the demobilizations officially ended in 2006. The new groups -- now referred to as ""criminal bands"" or BACRIMs, for the Spanish acronym -- include the Urabeños, the Rastrojos, ERPAC, the Paisas, the Machos, Aguilas Negras, and Renacer, among others. These groups are now dedicated to drug trafficking and organized crime, as well as attacks on civilians, especially activists and community leaders.For many Colombians, the peace process and the AUC's demobilization did not improve their situation. While more than 30,000 paramilitaries demobilized, many remained at large or abandoned the process and have since been implicated in grave human rights violations, drug trafficking, extortion, kidnappings and many other criminal acts.The paramilitaries' legacy extends beyond security. AUC members infiltrated the state and political parties, which has led to a series of investigations -- in which prominent legislators have been charged -- that have revealed what is known as the ""parapolitics"" scandal. The tradition of corruption continues to undermine and demoralize the Colombian government, and remains an integral factor in the ongoing violence in the country.",

The family's operations have traditionally been based in its hometown of Morales, which lies along the road running from the Honduran border to northern Guatemala. The family owned large tracts of land, and, in addition to drug trafficking, has been implicated in anti-union violence against local farm workers.The Mendozas made their fortune from contraband and drug smuggling, and were once considered to be protected by well-placed contacts in Guatemalan political circles. Former President Alvaro Colom once remarked the Mendozas were the among the ""narcos that nobody touches."" A mayor in Peten province -- where the drug trafficking organization is based -- reportedly received campaign donations in 2011 from the Mendozas after he shelled out nearly $2 million on a stadium for a soccer team owned by the family.However, the Mendozas lost key territories following the incursion of Mexican criminal group the Zetas into Guatemala, and many members of the drug clan are thought to have fled the country.","The alleged leader of the Mendozas, Haroldo Mendoza Matta, was arrested outside Guatemala City on November 20, 2014, as part of a massive security force operation that also produced the capture of nine other suspected members of the group.Another brother, Walter Obdulio Mendoza Mata, was sentenced to 16 years in prison for money laundering in May 2019. His four children were sentenced to six years.","The Mendozas' base of operations is in Peten, the northern-most province of Guatemala that lies along borders with Belize and Mexico.","The Mendozas sought political alliances with powerful members of the government and strategic alliances with other DTOs in the country. This may have included a short-lived agreement that some called the ""Pacto de Peten"" between themselves and the Lorenzanas to split the country north from south and push out the rival Leones, who they believed were responsible for stealing much of their merchandise. According to some Guatemalan sources, they used hired guns to attack the Leones, supposedly bringing in feared Mexican group the Zetas, who in March 2008, assassinated Juancho Leon in the Zacapa province. This strategy, however, backfired, and the Zetas co-opted territory in southeastern and central Guatemala.","Much of the Mendoza clan is thought to have left Peten, or to be regularly using Belize as a refuge. Nonetheless, they are also believed to have the best contacts in Guatemala’s government.",

Their influence and power, however, has been on the decline.","The Leones, headed by Juan Jose ""Juancho"" Leon Ardon, were initially involved in trafficking along the Salvadoran border. They later allied with the Gulf Cartel to traffick cocaine, and also began focusing on robbing cocaine shipments from other groups -- such as the Mendozas and Lorenzanas -- that were traveling through Zacapa.Once considered one of the most powerful and violent families in Guatemala, the Leones have since gone underground. On March 25, 2008, Zeta gunmen killed 11 members of the Leon clan in Zacapa, including Juancho (pictured), one of the group’s leaders.The reasons for this battle are not altogether clear. One theory is that the Mendozas and the Lorenzanas schemed to get rid of the Leones using the Zetas, an agreement dubbed the “Pacto de Peten.” Alternatively the massacre could have resulted from a broken Leones-Zetas alliance.The Leones continued to operate under the leadership of Juancho's brother, Haroldo, until he was murdered (allegedly by the Zetas) in 2011. Currently, very little of the organization appears to remain, with the Zetas having assumed control of the group's former activities.","The Leones were originally led by Juan Jose ""Juancho"" Leon Ardon, until his murder in 2008.

The group's criminal career ended in the early 2010s with the arrest and extradition of its top leaders.","The Lorenzanas were one of Guatemala's most long-running drug trafficking groups. The family had a relationship with Mexico's Sinaloa Cartel that stretched back at least two decades. Their reach once extended from Guatemala's poorest communities, whose support was bought with largesse, to the upper echelons of the country's political elite. However, in recent years they have become debilitated and their influence has declined.","Waldemar Lorenzana was arrested in December 2008 for alleged weapons possession but was soon released for reasons that illustrated their reach into the government justice system. In April 2010, the US Treasury Department froze the assets of Waldemar and his three sons, citing connections with the Sinaloa cartel. Then, after a change of government in Guatemala in 2011, the Lorenzana empire came crashing down. Waldemar Lorenzana and his sons, Eliu and Waldemar, were all arrested and later extradited to the United States. Shortly after his extradition to the United States, in August 2014, Waldemar Lorenzana pleaded guilty to drug crimes.

Águilas Negras,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/aguilas-negras/,Águilas Negras,,./images/organizations/águilas-negras.jpg,2017-03-09,"['águilas negras', 'colombia groups']",colombia,"The Águilas Negras, or Black Eagles, are a non-cohesive group dedicated to protecting the economic interests of former mid-level paramilitary commanders scattered across Colombia. Águilas Negras is often used as a generic term to describe the many fragments of ex-paramilitaries still trafficking drugs across Colombia. Frequently, paramilitary successors who have continued threatening or murdering journalists, lawyers and human rights activists have done so using the Águilas Negras name. This political bent, along with their lack of a central leadership, distinguishes them in part from the other criminal groups operating in Colombia.","The Águilas Negras emerged between 2004 and 2006, amidst Colombia's problematic demobilization of the AUC. The AUC was an umbrella organization of death squads – some of them formed in the 1980s – focused on two goals: fighting leftist guerrillas and making money, mostly through drug trafficking. One important faction, led by Carlos Castaño, tried to emphasize the AUC’s right-wing ideology and present the group as a political organization. This led to internal disputes within the AUC, and the fragile coalition broke as paramilitary leaders competed among themselves for territory, triggering horrific massacres and displacements. On 15 July 2003, the AUC agreed to enter negotiations with the government. In return for dismantling their forces and aiding criminal investigations, top AUC leaders were promised a degree of amnesty. A series of major disarmaments followed, and by 2006, 31,671 purported fighters had left the conflict.The demobilization, however, proved to be a false peace. Most paramilitary blocs only handed in a small fraction of their weapons. Young men were paid to falsely present themselves as ex-AUC combatants, while middle-level command remained untouched. Across Colombia, smaller paramilitary units kept their arms and remained in rural areas. Disguised as civilians they continued to run the same criminal enterprises: protecting coca cultivations, extorting land-owners and business contractors, persecuting human-rights activists and so on. In contrast to pre-2004 AUC blocs, most successor groups did not bother to present themselves as enemies of leftist guerrillas. In fact many would later ally with former supposed enemies, as occurred between the Popular Revolutionary Antiterrorist Army of Colombia (ERPAC) and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).Colombian media  and government has used ""Águilas Negras"" as a shifting and not strictly defined term. For example, the organization led by Daniel Rendon Herrera, and made up of ex-combatants from the Elmer Cardenas bloc, was at one time described as the Águilas Negras. The group would later evolve and become known as criminal group the Urabeños. Post-AUC drug traffickers operating in Antioquia and Cordoba have been referred to as the ""Águilas Negras of the North."" At other times, groups threatening lawyers, human-rights defenders and union leaders, have done so under the Águilas Negras name.Armed groups using the Águilas Negras title first appeared in 2006 in Catatumbo, Northern Santander and Nariño, some of Colombia's densest coca cultivation areas. Águilas Negras groups then began appearing in places valued as cocaine transit routes, such as Cordoba department's southern municipalities.Controlling former AUC drug trafficking corridors went hand in hand with protecting paramilitary land interests. In places like Cordoba, which saw some of the largest displacements by the AUC, the Águilas Negras were blamed for killing activists advocating for land repatriation. Similar threats against displaced activists have been registered in Santander. Armed groups styling themselves as the Águilas Negras have also spurred displacements in Sucre, Choco and the Uraba region in Antioquia.The appearance of the Águilas Negras was accompanied by the emergence of dozens of other criminal groups, usually linked to drug trafficking and targeted killings. A 2006 study by local think-tank Indepaz listed 62 active paramilitary successor groups in Colombia. It is possible that in some areas, low-level street gangs simply adopt the name ""Águilas Negras"" to better intimidate extortion and land theft victims.","There is little evidence that the Águilas Negras operate as a systematic organization. Instead, it appears to be the blanket name for the many successor groups willing to adapt the AUC’s tactics and, in many cases, its political discourse. Demobilized paramilitaries will likely make up the upper ranks of a given Águilas Negras group. Lower ranks may be composed of recruits dedicated to drug trafficking or other criminal activity.","Groups using the Águilas Negras name have appeared in at least 20 of Colombia’s 32 departments, including Nariño, Cauca, Casanare, Guajira, Magdalena, Bolivar, Northern Santander, Santander, Bolivar, Sucre and Cordoba. Cells have also been reported in the Venezuelan states of Tachira and Zulia. The Águilas Negras have generally built upon criminal networks established by their paramilitary predecessors. They are not known to control any transnational cocaine shipment routes.",Individual Águilas Negras groups are known to compete with rival gangs and drug traffickers over criminal interests as well as cooperate with former paramilitary-enemies like the FARC and the ELN.,Due to their structure it is impossible to track down and dismantle any Águilas Negras central leadership. Tracking the Águilas Negras' ascendancy or decline is difficult as various armed groups lay claim to the name. In 2011 Colombia passed legislation opening the way to for comprehensive land reform and repatriation. There is a risk that Águilas Negras groups may be contracted to intimidate those whose land repatriation efforts threaten economic interests.,

The group has lost power and relevance due to infighting within its ranks, as well as a brutal feud with competitor groups over access to smuggling routes to Colombia's coasts. Many key members have defected to the rival Urabeños, and it is arguable whether the Paisas still exist as a significant force.","Like many of its counterparts, the Paisas’ core was made up of remnants of the paramilitary groups that demobilized during a peace process with the government between 2004 and 2006. ""Paisa"" is the nickname typically used for locals from Antioquia, and the group’s stronghold was concentrated in that province. One-time kingpin of the Medellin underworld Diego Murillo, alias ""Don Berna,"" used to maintain groups of urban thugs and ex-paramilitaries in the countryside to battle guerrilla forces, control drug trafficking routes and occasionally jostle with rival paramilitary leaders like Daniel Rendon, alias ""Don Mario.""Don Berna’s network was called the Oficina de Envigado. Following Don Berna’s extradition in 2008, the rural militia broke away from the Oficina and began launching increasingly furious offensives against Don Mario's forces, who were later dubbed the Urabeños, after their heartland in the region of Urabá. The Paisas and the Urabeños continue to clash even after Don Mario's arrest in 2008.The Paisas recruited mostly from paramilitary soldiers that demobilized between 2004-2006, and their modus operandi was similar to that of a paramilitary group. Working in mostly small villages and towns, they try and control the flow of drugs to the coast, where they sell them on to organizations that have larger infrastructures and can move drugs internationally. Authorities believe this includes Mexican criminal syndicate the Zetas. They also control “micro-trafficking” in areas under their command, as well as extorting local businesses and farms.The Paisas were known for being ruthless, eliminating their enemies and, at times, families of their enemies in an attempt to instill fear. The group relied on many young hitmen who cut their teeth in the United Self Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia - AUC). Within this context, the Paisas set their sights on destroying the Urabeños at all costs and had reached agreements with other drug trafficking groups, among them fronts of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia - FARC).","The Paisas leadership originally consisted of former mid-level commanders of the AUC paramilitary network. However, many of the group's top leaders were killed or captured.The group has also been hit by a wave of defections. Commander Angel de Jesus Pacheco Chanci, alias ""Sebastian,"" left to join the Rastrojos in 2009, before being murdered by his own bodyguards in July 2011. His faction of the Paisas, working alongside the Rastrojos, was believed to supply drugs to the Gulf Cartel and the Zetas.The death of another Paisas commander, Cesar Augusto Torres Lujan, alias ""Mono Vides,"" in October provoked more desertions. His allies Rafael Alvarez Piñeda, alias ""Chepe,"" and German Bustos Alarcon, alias ""El Puma,"" (captured in September 2011) left to join the Urabeños. They were recruited by a former colleague from the AUC's Mineros Bloc, Roberto Vargas Gutierrez, alias ""Gavilan."" There is currently no visible leadership other than local leaders in regions where the Paisas have operations.","At the height of its power, the group operated in seven departments, concentrated in Colombia's rural northwest. In 2009, homicide rates skyrocketed in the northern half of Antioquia due to clashes between the Paisas and rival gangs like the Rastrojos, the Urabeños and the Aguilas Negras. This hotly contested region is a key corridor for cocaine traffickers and coca growers, as it connects to both the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans.Since 2018, the Ombudsman's Office has warned about the presence of Los Paises in Bogota and Soacha, where the group has concentrated its activities primarily on drug distribution and the recruitment of minors to strengthen its structure. The departments of Huila and Tolima have also seen a growth in criminal activities related to the organization. ","The Paisas are enemies with the Urabeños, and fight the group for control and influence over drug trafficking and other criminal activities in the Medellin area.","The Paisas have been weakened by desertions and the arrests of its leaders. Additionally, the group has experienced setbacks in confronting the rivals group, the Urabeños, which have proved to be a much stronger organization. The group's decline has led to activities focused on controlling microtrafficking, especially in urban and municipal environments, with few opportunities for growth.",
CIACS,https://insightcrime.org/guatemala-organized-crime-news/ciacs/,CIACS,,./images/organizations/ciacs.jpg,2017-03-09,"['arms trafficking', 'ciacs', 'guatemala', 'guatemala groups']",guatemala,"Guatemala's 40-year civil war laid the groundwork for many criminal organizations, including several that spawned from state intelligence and military services. These organizations, collectively known as Illegal Clandestine Security Apparatuses (Cuerpos Ilegales y Aparatos Clandestinos de Seguridad - CIACS), are still operational, assisting in drug trafficking and illegal adoptions, the making of false passports and contraband. They include several ex-generals and former high-ranking intelligence officers, and their connections to the private side security services in Guatemala, plus their understanding of how to penetrate and corrupt the government make them useful partners and potent individual actors in the underworld.","The origins of the Illegal Clandestine Security Apparatuses (Cuerpos Ilegales y Aparatos Clandestinos de Seguridad - CIACS) are in Guatemala's civil conflict. What began as a fight for land and labor rights in the 1950s became a full-scale civil war in the 1960s. Several guerrilla groups emerged, both urban and rural, some of which included former military officers. Amidst the turmoil, the Guatemalan army seized power and held it until the mid-1980s. Along the way they created an elaborate and somewhat sophisticated intelligence apparatus, the most important part of which was the Estado Mayor Presidencial (EMP).The government set up the EMP in the mid-1970s to protect the president and his family. But with time, it evolved into an intelligence gathering service. Staffed by military personnel, most of whom had worked in the military's most feared intelligence services, it soon turned its attention to opposition forces and political movements who threatened its control over the government and its ability to cover up its past war crimes. The information was placed in files, or ""archivos,"" giving the EMP its moniker: ""los archivos.""During the 1980s, as the country shifted from military to civilian rule, the EMP worked to keep opposition in check and ensure that past abuses during the civil war went unpunished. It did this by systematically tracking, harrassing, and in some cases arresting human rights workers, union members and student activists, among others. Some faced torture. Others were simply executed or disappeared. One military intelligence document, obtained from Guatemala's government archives by the National Security Archives, listed 183 Guatemalans that the EMP disappeared between 1983 and 1985. The EMP was also responsible for the 1990 murder of the anthropologist Myrna Mack in 1990. And its personnel were behind the 1998 murder of Bishop Juan Gerardi, who had led an investigation into war crimes during the country's civil conflict.The EMP was abolished in 2003, but it was at the heart of what many called the ""hidden powers,"" or CIACS, that continued to have a strong hand in running the Guatemalan government for years thereafter. Military intelligence services such as the G-2 and the D-2 were also part of these powers. They drew from their past connections to become a type of parallel government. Some of them took on names like the Cofradia or La Montaña and battled for control with each other over the lucrative businesses they managed. These businesses included providing intelligence and weapons, hitmen services and fake passports to criminal groups. They were facilitators more than operators, and their vast knowledge of the state and political connections within it, made them invaluable to other underworld operators and political parties alike. Some eventually formed their own political movements. A former EMP commander, Otto Perez Molina, is now the Guatemala's president.In 2007, the government opened the door for the United Nations International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), which has been working to dismantle the CIACS. Its case against former Guatemalan President Alfonso Portillo is illustrative of the CICIG's mixed results. According to the US indictment against the ex-president, retired General Francisco Ortega Menaldo orchestrated at least part of the pillaging of state resources that led to the arrest of the former president and his defense minister.The US pulled Ortega's visa in 2002, for his alleged contacts with drug trafficking organizations. He is also thought to have ties to an organization that sells Guatemalan passports to foreigners. However, Guatemalan authorities have never indicted Ortega, and Ortega has consistently denied any wrongdoing or connections to these ""hidden powers."" Portillo and two of Ortega's close associates, however, spent time in jail for embezzlement, and Portillo was extradited to the US where he was convicted of money laundering charges. After spending a year and a half in US prison, Portillo returned to Guatemala in February 2015.Given his background in the EMP, many expected President Perez Molina not to renew the CICIG's mandate on coming to power. However, after assuming the presidency, Perez extended CICIG's mandate for a further two years until September 2015. In April 2015, after much debate and political maneuvering -- and amidst a crisis in his administration due to a customs fraud scandal -- Perez renewed CICIG's mandate for another two years. ",,"The CIACS operates throughout Guatemala, but its core groups are centered in the Guatemala City, near the halls of government power.",,,
Oficina de Envigado,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/oficina-de-envigado-profile/,Oficina de Envigado,,./images/organizations/oficina-de-envigado.jpg,2020-10-28,"['colombia groups', 'colombia mafia', 'don berna', 'oficina de envigado', 'sebastian (oficina)', 'valenciano']",colombia,"The Oficina de Envigado has evolved from a debt collection agency for Pablo Escobar to a mafia federation that regulates almost all criminal activity in Medellín.Today’s Oficina is a coalition of mid-sized criminal organizations that provide services to transnational drug traffickers and other mafia elites, and use alliances with gangs to control territory and criminal activities in Medellín. As such, it is perhaps the most complex example of the Colombian mafia today: a tangled web of service providers and subcontractors involved in everything from money laundering and the international cocaine trade to street level drug sales and micro-extortion.","Pablo Escobar set up the Oficina de Envigado in the 1980s as the first ""oficina de cobro,"" or criminal debt collection agency. The Oficina de Envigado was literally an office in the town hall in Envigado, the small municipality adjacent to Medellín where Escobar grew up. Escobar used the municipal offices to collect debts owed him by other drug traffickers of the Medellín Cartel. Any trafficker who fell behind on his payments could find himself threatened and beaten by the Oficina de Envigado, or even assassinated by its “sicarios,” or cartel hitmen.After Escobar’s death, organized crime in Medellín was taken over by Diego Murillo, alias “Don Berna,” a former cartel enforcer who had turned on Escobar. Don Berna established himself as the chief mediator, regulator and debt collector in the underworld using the Oficina de Envigado as his vehicle to power. He also established wide-ranging links with Medellín's security forces, judicial sector and political and business elites, establishing ties between the Oficina de Envigado and the city elites that endure today.In the late 1990s, Don Berna became a commander of the paramilitary umbrella organization the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia – AUC). He used this position to camouflage the Oficina with the banner of counterinsurgency, setting up rural factions and rebranding the Oficina’s urban hitmen networks as the Cacique Nutibara Bloc of the AUC.Around the turn of the century, Berna, working in conjunction with the city elites, began a pacification of Medellín. His Oficina units, disguised as paramilitaries, wiped out guerrilla militias, put down a rebellion of one of Medellín’s most feared sicario networks, La Terraza, and destroyed a rival AUC faction, the Metro Bloc, which challenged his hegemony in Colombia’s second city. After seizing complete control of Medellín, Don Berna ordered the Oficina to keep murders at a minimum, resulting in a dramatic fall in the city homicide rates and a period in the city known as “donbernabilidad,” -- a pun on the Spanish word “gobernabilidad,” or governability.Don Berna demobilized with other AUC leaders in 2003, along with several hundred of his Cacique Nutibara Bloc troops. But he was imprisoned in 2005 when authorities connected him to the assassination of a local politician after talks between the government and the AUC had begun. Nonetheless, in prison Don Berna continued running his operations at a safe distance from his enemies, while on the outside, his spokesman, Carlos Mario Aguilar, alias “Rogelio,” along with a former paramilitary, Daniel Alberto Mejía, alias “Danielito,” managed the Oficina’s drug trafficking and assassin networks.Don Berna was extradited in May 2008 to the United States, along with 13 other paramilitary leaders. His departure triggered a splintering of the Oficina and a power struggle among would-be successors.On the one side of this war of succession stood Maximiliano Bonilla, alias “Valenciano,” one of the Oficina’s most powerful international drug traffickers, who controlled important trafficking routes through the Caribbean coast. On the other stood Erick Vargas, alias “Sebastian,” who had little influence in the transnational cocaine trade but commanded the loyalty of the majority of the gangs of Medellín.Sebastian eventually emerged as the winner in the war and his victory was sealed when Valenciano was arrested in Venezuela in 2011. However, with Valenciano’s arrest and defeat, the Oficina lost control of its primary trafficking routes. Power had shifted from the Oficina’s drug trafficking wing to its armed, territorial wing.Sebastian had little time to enjoy his success as the Oficina immediately faced a new foe, the Urabeños, who had gained a foothold in the city by supporting Valenciano. They also inherited many of Valenciano’s drug routes after his arrest. The Urabeños ultimate aim was to merge their rural drug trafficking empire with the city’s lucrative criminal economies and money laundering potential. They offered money and military grade weaponry to local gangs to turn them against the Oficina, which enabled them to seize several key strategic areas in a bloody war played out in the city’s peripheral neighborhoods.In 2012, the Oficina suffered a further blow with the arrest of Sebastian and several other key leaders in August, followed by a massacre in December in which one of the leading candidates to replace him was killed. Into the power vacuum, stepped Juan Carlos Mesa Vallejo, alias “Tom,” a gang leader who had risen from the streets to head the Los Chatas criminal organization and one of the leading suspects in the December massacre.However, the Oficina was no longer a hierarchical structure and Tom was no maximum leader. The various oficinas de cobro that had made up the Oficina de Envigado were by now largely independent, and Tom was simply the most influential voice at the table rather than a supreme commander. Behind him stood even more powerful figures, hidden transnational drug traffickers known as the “invisibles” and white-collar criminals from the city elites.In mid-2013, a truce was brokered between the Urabeños and the Oficina at the behest of certain invisibles, who were concerned the conflict was affecting both their criminal and legal business interests. The deal saw the Oficina gain access to their rivals’ international drug trafficking routes in exchange for allowing the Urabeños to stake their claim to territory in the Medellín underworld. The impact was an immediate and drastic drop in the city murder rate.Despite localized outbursts of gang violence, the criminal peace has largely held ever since. However, Tom’s reign at the head of the Oficina de Envigado came to an end in December 2017, when he was arrested at his own 50th birthday party.","Leading figures within the Oficina retain significant stakes in the drug trade, maintaining contacts with Mexican cartels and control over drug trafficking routes. However, the Oficina de Envigado as an organization is less a drug cartel and more a service provider to drug traffickers. The composite parts of the Oficina specialize in assassinations, kidnappings, and the collection of drug debts as well as running extensive money laundering networks.Each of the different factions of the Oficina de Envigado is also financially self-sufficient and today they run wide-ranging microtrafficking and extortion networks as well as controlling or taking a cut from a broad range of criminal activities such as robberies, contraband, the sex trade and adulterated alcohol sales.Since Tom was captured, Colombian authorities have continued to target La Oficina's leadership, arresting Juan Carlos Castro, alias “Pichi”, believed to be Tom's successor in August 2018. Two other key leaders, John Eduard Barbosa, alias “Barbosa,” and Jhon Fredy Yepes Hoyos, alias “Clemente,” were captured in 2019.","Today’s Oficina de Envigado is a federation principally comprised of eight mid-size oficinas or, as the police call them, Criminal Organizations Integrated With Drug Trafficking (Organizaciones Delincuenciales Integradas al Narcotráfico - ODIN): Los Chatas, Picacho, Caicedo, La Terraza, La Union, Robledo, Trianon and San Pablo. These oficinas control territory and criminal activities in Medellín through alliances with gangs known as “combos.” The oficinas that together form the Oficina de Envigado control around 65 percent of the city combos, with the rest working for either independent oficinas or those allied with the Urabeños.These individual oficinas work together as a loose-knit coalition. However, their primary concern is their own interests, and internal divisions are common. With the arrest of Tom in December 2017, no one leader has been publicly identified as the head of the organization as a whole. However, behind these visible armed structures, lie the true powers of the Oficina de Envigado: elite drug traffickers and white-collar criminals that move between the underworld and the legal world and pull the strings of the oficinas.","The Oficina de Envigado’s territorial base is the city of Medellín and the towns in the Medellín metropolitan area such as Envigado, Bello, Itagui and Sabaneta. Oficina factions also control international drug trafficking routes, especially from the north of the country, and their presence has been reported in the drug production zones of the department of Antioquia.","Since the truce struck in 2013, the Oficina’s principal enemies, the Urabeños, have become important drug trafficking allies. They also work closely with Mexican cartels, in particular the Sinaloa Cartel. Today, their principal threat comes from internal divisions and disputes between factions.","The operational lifecycle of visible leaders of the Oficina de Envigado is short and getting shorter. After leaders such as Rogelio surrendered to the US authorities, and others, including Sebastian, cut deals after being arrested, US and Colombian law enforcement have been armed with a wealth of insider information that has helped them take out leader after leader. Most of the network’s best-known figures are now in prison and those that replace them can expect a similar fate once they have been exposed. However, these arrests have little bearing on the functioning of the Oficina as a mafia network, and both the criminal activities it runs in Medellín and the drug trafficking that Oficina-linked figures run or contract out will likely continue unimpeded for the foreseeable future."
ERPAC,https://insightcrime.org/colombia-organized-crime-news/erpac/,ERPAC,,./images/organizations/erpac.jpg,2017-03-10,"['colombia groups', 'erpac']",colombia,"ERPAC’s stronghold was in the Meta, Guaviare, Vichada and Casanare provinces of the Eastern Plains. It controlled production of base and processed cocaine, which it sold to middlemen or exported through networks in Venezuela and Brazil. Since the 2011 surrender, the remnants of the group are thought to have divided into two rival factions, the Meta Bloc and the Libertadores de Vichada.","Like many of the groups currently running the country's drug trade, known collectively by the government as ""criminal bands,"" or BACRIMs, the ERPAC is descended from the paramilitary United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia (AUC). Its roots lie in fighting between right-wing proxies of the government, and leftist guerrillas from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) in the Eastern Plains. There, members of what was known as the Centauros Bloc, under the leadership of Jose Miguel Arroyave, battled FARC rebels for control of the region.But from the beginning, the Centauros seemed more interested in the commercial than the military side of their work, which is why, in 2003-04, they launched a fight against a rival paramilitary group for control of the lucrative drug route through Casanare province near the Venezuelan and Brazilian borders. More than 1,000 died in the fighting. The Centauros won the battle, but more infighting followed. In September 2004, a group led by Pedro Oliverio Guerrero, alias ""Cuchillo,"" ambushed and killed Centauros leader Arroyave.The dissident groups implicated in the killing formed the Heroes de Llano and Heroes del Guaviare blocs, led by Manuel de Jesus Piraban, alias ""Pirata,"" and CuchilloThe two groups officially demobilized in September 2006 along with other paramilitary groups as part of the Justice and Peace process, with 1,765 men handing in 1,025 arms. However, Cuchillo secretly stockpiled weapons and rearmed with around 200 rebels, who became the founders of ERPAC.The ERPAC thrived by allying itself with Daniel Barrera Barrera, alias ""El Loco,"" and doing business with its former enemy, the FARC. Barrera, who was also aligned with the powerful Rastrojos criminal gang, was one of Colombia’s most powerful drug traffickers until he was captured in Venezuela in September 2012. The ERPAC and Barrera used the Eastern Plains as their headquarters and regularly purchased coca base, the raw material used to make powdered cocaine, from the FARC, before processing and exporting it via Venezuela and Brazil. Authorities believe Cuchillo and Barrera exported between 2 and 3 tons per month. Some of their product went to Europe via impoverished West African nations such as Guinea-Bissau. They also sold their product to Mexican drug cartels operating in Mexico, Guatemala and other transit nations. In March 2010, the US Treasury designated Cuchillo and Barrera the two most wanted Colombian traffickers.The ERPAC did more than traffic drugs. Using its overwhelming firepower, this group also stole land, robbed trucks, rustled cattle and extorted money from local businesses and wealthy farmers. Its contacts in the armed forces and police gave the group an advantage against its rivals.","The ERPAC was a former army and operated as such, gaining military control of territory in order to process and store illegal drugs, as well as terrorizing the local population into submitting to its will. It had little ideology, and formed strategic alliances with Loco Barrera and its former enemies in the FARC in order to make money. The ERPAC operates mostly in remote areas of the Eastern Plains such as the departments of Casanare, Guaviare, Meta and Vichada. It bought coca base from the FARC, processed it in the Eastern Plains and exported it, mostly out of Venezuela by airplane or via the Pacific coast by boat. It attempted to expand to other areas, including Norte de Santander and the Magdalena Medio region in the heart of the country. Some cells of the group also appeared in Huila, Caqueta, Cauca and Putumayo, traditional guerrilla strongholds. Police intelligence reports say the ERPAC also had a ""presence"" in Arauca, Cundinamarca and Guainia.The group fought battles with other powers in the Eastern Plains, including strongman Victor Carranza, known as Colombia's ""Emerald Tsar,"" and remnants of former paramilitary group the Peasant Self-Defense Groups of Casanare (Autodefensas Campesinas de Casanare - ACC). The fight with the ACC dated back to 2003-2004, when the Centauros Bloc battled the group for control of the lucrative drug routes through the Eastern Plains. ERPAC also fought with other former paramilitary groups that have turned into criminal organizations, namely the Macacos, who operated under the auspices of the now extradited leader of the Central Bolivar Bloc, Carlos Mario Jimenez, alias ""Macaco.""Evidence has also emerged pointing to collaboration between the ERPAC and corrupt elements in the police, army and intelligence agency the DAS, which is now disbanded.The ERPAC suffered a series of heavy blows from 2009 onwards, with the arrest of top operatives included founding members Martin Farfan, alias ""Pijarbey,"" (arrested December 2009) and Jose Covey Romero Zarate, who handled drug shipments from Vichada to Venezuela (arrested May 2010). In order to fill the holes in the ERPAC's command, Cuchillo's brother, Dumar de Jesus Guerrero Castillo, alias ""Carecuchillo,"" escaped from prison and tried to reconnect with the group. However, he was recaptured a few months later.In another sign of the group losing momentum in the Eastern Plains, the ERPAC botched a second assassination attempt against its rival Victor Carranza in March 2010. The group did manage to deepen its relationship with the FARC, after Guerrero met with the head of the 39th Front in eastern Meta order to negotiate the movement of drugs and precursor chemicals through rebel-controlled territory.The most significant blow against the ERPAC came in Christmas 2010, when Cuchillo drowned in a creek while trying to escape a police raid on his ranch in Mapiripan, Meta. His second-in-command, Harold Humberto Rojas, alias ""El Loco Harold,"" was also captured during the operation. He was the head of the ERPAC's security detail, meaning the man next-in-line to take command was the group's head of finances, another life-long paramilitary warrior.The ERPAC's new leader, Jose Eberto Lopez Montero, alias ""Caracho,"" lacked Guerrero's charisma and contacts in the drug trade. He soon faced the prospect of a fragmented ERPAC when a faction in Guaviare abandoned the group and began working as mercenaries for the FARC's 1st Front. Caracho moved quickly to confront the threat, sending a team of 50 armed men to defend ERPAC territory in the department. But there were further challenges to his command, as other mid-level operatives tried to strike out on their own and establish their own drug-trafficking operations.Unable to hold the organization together, and perhaps hoping to take advantage of the soon-to-expire ""Justice and Peace"" Law which gave benefits to demobilizing paramilitaries, Caracho led some 272 members in a surrender to the government in December 2011. The majority were immediately freed, as there were no arrest warrants against them. Many were later recaptured, and as of September 2012 some 150 had been convicted, most of them sentenced to just four years and four months in prison.Those surrendering made up less than half of the group's estimated fighters at that time, and the remnants are carrying on the ERPAC's business in its old territory. However, they split into several splinter groups. The two main groups, the Liberators of Vichada/ Heroes of Vichada (Libertadores del Vichada/Heroes de Vichada) led by the now released ""Pijarbey,"" and the Meta Bloc, led by Rubber Antonio Navarro Caicedo, alias ""Flaco Fredy.""This battle, and the capture of Flaco Fredy in September 2012, has allowed the Urabeños to gain influence in the region by backing the faction controlled by Pijarbey. The situation was complicated by the September 2012 arrest of Barrera. He was believed to have been backing the Meta faction of the ERPAC in their war against Pijarbey's Vichada faction. The Urabeños appeared to have been backing Pijarbey in the dispute, most likely with arms, cash and possibly shock troops, and with the Meta faction no longer able to count on the support of their powerful patron, the stage was set for another Urabeños ally to establish dominance and possibly become a faction of the Urabeños franchise.In October of 2013 another rival of the Vichada faction was eliminated when Armando Carvajal Morales, alias ""Mello"", was shot dead in Bogota in what was reported to be a ""revenge"" attack. Carvajal was considered to be a top commander of a group known as the Rudos, and, with 50 men under his direct command, led the Rudos with his brother Martin Carvajal, alias ""Kike.""Pijarbey now stands in a position to take control of the region, especially as intelligence reports suggest the Vichada faction continues to have success recruiting, with their numbers increasing from 143 to 200 since February 2012. The Urabeños numbers also continue to swell and as Colombia’s dominant criminal group they are believed to be Pijarbey's key ally against the Meta Block.",,,,
