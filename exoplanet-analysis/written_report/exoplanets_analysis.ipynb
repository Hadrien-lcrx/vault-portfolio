Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest provided encouraging results, with a recall ranging from 0.4 to 0.6.

We trained a voting classifier, but this didn't improve results as the stars correctly identified were the same for all the models, so there was no combined effectiveness improvement effect.

    "on the [Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes website](https://archive.stsci.edu/missions-and-data/kepler), so the integrality of the data could be used. More qualified data would most likely help improve the model. Doing so would require some additional data preprocessing effort on the light curves data to match the structure of the Winter Delta dataset, and to convert `.fits` data to the `.csv` format. We could rely on the [Kepler Data Processing Handbook](https://archive.stsci.edu/files/live/sites/mast/files/home/missions-and-data/kepler/_documents/KSCI-19081-002-KDPH.pdf) for this effort. The data might also be enriched with K2 campaign data, K2 being the mission that followed into\n",

    "#### Leveraging image data\n",
    "More data could also be be added on top of the simple light intensity observations to feed more features to our model (full frame images, target pixel files...). Image analysis and computer vision techniques could then be leveraged, but might prove computing intensive or costly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding more variables\n",
    "In this project, we rely on a unique variable: light intensity. More features could prove useful for identification, for example orbital period, transit epoch, eccentricity value, longitude of periastron, transition period, transit depth, object radius... All of this data can be gathered if we suspect the star is orbitted by an object. Such data is already gathered by NASA in the [Kepler Objects of Interest Table](https://exoplanetarchive.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/API_kepcandidate_columns.html).\n",

    "There is an [open catalogue of identified exoplanets](http://openexoplanetcatalogue.com/) that is maintained and updated on a [GitHub repository](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/open_exoplanet_catalogue) by Hanno Rein, an astrophysics professor at the univeristy of Toronto. A model could be trained on such a dataset to better learn and memorize the characteristics of exoplanets, and improve identification results, especially if coupled with the addition of features as suggested above.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Experimenting with neural networks\n",
    "We tried a simple neural network which didn't yield encouraging results, but it's possible that a well-tuned neural network could outperform our current model. It's worth a try."
